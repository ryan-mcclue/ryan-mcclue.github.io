<p>Make-A-Video AI seems promising</p>
<p>Good news first ever drug to slow down cognitive decline of
Alzheimer’s</p>
<p>DreamFusion 2D-to-3D looks promising</p>
<p>Will future cars will be synced with mobile OSs from Apple or
Android?</p>
<p>Unfortunately malware spreads through low-hanging CVEs or social
engineering</p>
<p>Memory market collapse, i.e. a type of chip market</p>
<p>How nice that Apple’s anti-tracking crackdown only applies to
third-party apps</p>
<p>With the growth of hardware, really seems that adaptive learning
algorithms are going to be used instead of solving the problem
explicitly More companies branching into GPUs with AI functionality,
e.g. Intel Arc, Acer etc. Furthermore, more companies branching into VR,
e.g. Lenovo, Facebook etc.</p>
<p>Is a smart ring really any better than a smart watch?</p>
<p>As you would expect, Raptor Lake CPUs faster single thread speed at a
lower wattage</p>
<p>Will it be common place for actors to sell likeness for
deepfakes?</p>
<p>Again, YouTube offers another thorn; restricting 4K access to
subscribers</p>
<h1 id="news---scaling-the-libra">NEWS - Scaling the Libra</h1>
<p>Xcode cloud subscription. oh no wasting so much time on naming of new
processes, e.g. ‘Developer Experience Infrastructure’</p>
<p>Another billionaire investing in a ‘utopian cities’ seems more
dystopic than anything. Promulgation of venture capitalists, angel
investors, etc.</p>
<p>PIC have weird instruction set, so generally have to use with
assembly over C compiler (no good free compiler) So, use AVR for low-end
like just LED driving? e.g. TLC5971</p>
<p>time-of-flight sensor like an infrared radar</p>
<p>over-current and over-voltage detectors for when using charging
devices, e.g USB-C charger? so, perhaps investigate/understand voltage
regulators? also have UVLO (undervoltage-lockout)</p>
<p>new USB-PD (power delivery) interface more power from USB-C</p>
<p>I can see machine learning ‘appropriate’ in say cleaning up random
noise, e.g. brain signals</p>
<p>interesting set of questions to inspect a software engineering
workplace:
https://neverworkintheory.org/2022/08/30/software-engineering-research-questions.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter</p>
<p>things like database accelerator library indicative of normal
software not being fast</p>
<p>MOSFETs are a type of transistor. different transistors for say
quick-switching, low signal, high frequency, amplifier etc.</p>
<p>USB-4, PCI5, DDR5 emerging standards.</p>
<p>Could buy a GPU for running interesting machine learning applications
like Stable Diffusion (prompt engineers, oh dear…) https://www.krea.ai/
GPU structure similar to CPUs, e.g have cache, GDDR6 memory (more simple
parrellisation)</p>
<p>float-toy nice web visualistion tool</p>
<p>interestingly CRT can scale better than fixed-set resolution LCD</p>
<p>new TV monitor combination QD-OLED curved monitors less fatiguing as
physically matches our eye’s shape flexible/bendable monitors no one
asked for…</p>
<p>cool looking completely submerged server desktops. pure water is a
very good insulator (our tap water will have chlorine for example)
obtained via ozone treatment</p>
<p>the Nintendo DSi implemented augmented reality virtual reality is
completely immersive</p>
<p>how does wireless charging work without a pad, i.e. no induction
charging? interesting power sharing from phone to watch</p>
<p>trie -&gt; gzip. still have to decode and resulting memory same as
before compression succinct data structures are designed to not have to
be decoded, i.e. everything is stored as bits. ∴ uses a lot less memory
(however, only for larger datasets)</p>
<p>compound literals issues with debugger and maintanence</p>
<p>C11 static assertions, how to use? performance improvements? static
const char sound_signature[] = { #embed &lt;sdk/jump.wav&gt; };
static_assert((sizeof(sound_signature) / sizeof(*sound_signature)) &gt;=
4, “There should be at least 4 elements in this array.”); anonymous
structs int fnc(int arr[static 2])</p>
<p>C23 can prevent VLA by defining constexpr true, false keywords
nullptr (it’s a pointer not number) enum e : unsigned short { x }; digit
separators function attributes</p>
<p>smarter devices not necessarily better, e.g. printer’s with
end-of-life software</p>
<p>lol, ferrocene is a developing rust toolchain</p>
<p>PLC more expensive microcontroller that is more versatile,
e.g. handle voltage overload (often used in assembly lines)</p>
<p>removing shared pointers probably gives later code in the pipeline a
small cache boost as all the data is now co-located excessive logging
cause for bad performance excessive heap usage bad for performance if on
an OS note there is static, stack and heap memory areas</p>
<p>lol, killedbygoogle.com. perhaps not wise to rely on new services</p>
<p>is self-administration the only benefit of an inhaled COVID
vaccine?</p>
<p>doesn’t seem like quantum computers will be able to solve any
practical tasks (unless program exploits quantum parrelism to a large
extent)</p>
<p>cloud computing with containers growing, e.g. AWS/Azure ➞ Kubernetes
➞ docker</p>
<p>it’s sad, but you really could do a stand-up of modern software
projects, e.g. “introducing Goliath, an automatic external dependency
manager. under the hood we use a Nextrus package manager. can be
scripted with Freasy language extension of Frosty core language”</p>
<p>seems a lot of phones adding satellite connectivity even though it’s
much slower</p>
<p>although space travel seems like the future, how to cope with serious
health affects like space radiation</p>
<p>opening up web pages from tech news sites just awful. inudated with
floating content-blocking video ads, permanent marquee ads embedded
beween paragraphs and browser title bar flashing with bot message
notification, bot message popup, cookies accept bar, …</p>
<p>asciinema useful terminal recording tool with website to host</p>
<p>potential for sim-locking being a thing of the past with a push to
eSIM cards</p>
<p>New AI that can edit videos with textual prompts The dramatic shift
in technology that mobile and cloud devices have brought is being
realised by natural language processing As text is seen as a universal
input in a lot of Unix programs, interesting possibilities.</p>
<p>eyes convert photons to electrochemical signal transduction converts
one energy form to another CCD (charged couple device; less noise, more
power, lower speed) and CMOS (consumer grade) common camera sensors
digital cameras convert photons to array of pixels, represented as
voltage levels quad pixel camera sensor combines four adjacent pixels in
this array</p>
<p>round design of new Nvidia GPU may be evidence for the 20-year
cyclical nature of fashion</p>
<p>amazing new 6GHz stock speed Intel CPU</p>
<p>although all crypto is ponzi scheme, it seems the goals of Ethereum
to perform secure financial transactions is headed in a better direction
than BitCoin. furthermore following The Merge, it does not rely on power
hungry mining. this is in term has led to a lot of 2nd-hand GPUs
flooding the market</p>
<p>avx512 cant actually get performance stated by Intel ‘marketing’ as
it causes heat up and cpu thermal throttles</p>
<p>good to see some work being done on the interopability of digital
wallets</p>
<p>in general, Occum’s razor approach to muscular issues</p>
<p>smart power homes whereby the source of the power can be discerned,
i.e. if it’s clean or not. extends to phone chargers with knowledge of
this</p>
<p>interesting Github Copilot Labs able to do rough translations between
languages</p>
<p>good to see (in some ways) hardware vendors pushing for AI standards
to allow for greater optimisation</p>
<p>ATM machines can be targeted for card-skimmers</p>
<p>possibility of sprite animation in terminal using chafa tool to
create ascii block art</p>
<p>Intel new naming scheme confusing using brand name as category,
i.e. ‘Intel Processor’ instead of ‘Pentium’</p>
<p>YouTube no respect for customers, running clandenstine experiment
running up to 5 ads at the start instead of spacing them out
Furthermore, Mozilla researchers found that buttons like ‘Stop
recommending’, ‘Dislike’ have next to no effect</p>
<p>Growing space economy with NASA ISS becoming privatised</p>
<p>Gaming phones with extended fans/cooling and amenable gripping
features</p>
<p>I suppose it would be kind of cool to travel in a plane going Mach
1</p>
<p>There can be such extremes in software, e.g. from programming
hardware in FPGA to writing natural-language descriptions for an AI to
convert to code</p>
<p>Cool 3D printing pens, although slow, can be used to say repair a
chipped brick</p>
<p>Cool USB SAMD boards (possible malware creation)</p>
<p>Amazing creations from AI from still images, videos, digital
assistants: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1572210382944538624.html
Companies like DeepMind, OpenAI chatbot AI used in UI testing GPU DLSS
(deep learning super sampling) is AI upscaling</p>
<p>Finally, alleviating ambigious USB 4.0 v2.0 naming scheme with
devices having clear USB 40Gbps, 240W printed on them</p>
<p>Compelled to investigate a service like paperspace in order to run
OpenAI and other AI projects</p>
<p>Promising Framework laptop build to easily repair in mind. However,
subpar experience</p>
<p>Teachers are fired for moonlighting</p>
<p>Record breaking DDos attacks, 17.2million requests per second,
3.4terabits per second, 809million packets per second</p>
<p>Google have size to challenge Dolby with new HD audio standard.
However, whilst seeming altruistic, is just so they don’t have to pay
Dolby licensing fees in their hardware</p>
<p>Interesting Domain Brokerage services to allow you to get already
used domains</p>
<p>Amount limiting will not work to prevent MFA fatigue attacks</p>
<p>Record-breaking figures acheived with overclocking can be decieving
as may employ high-end coolers or even liquid nitrogen</p>
<p>Still Windows updates break things, e.g. NVidia drivers</p>
<p>The inundation of Javascript web frameworks has provided a learning
point for adopting new technologies. In general, stick to familiar
technologies and only adopted bleeding edge later</p>
<p>Cool application of IoT:
https://hackaday.com/2015/11/24/building-the-infinite-matrix-of-tamagotchis/</p>
<p>Although lower-res, CDs aren’t lossy compressed like Bluetooth or
spotify.</p>
<p>Amazing gigabit speeds being sold for ISPs</p>
<p>Sad that bariatrics is even a field of medicine</p>
<p>Serverless is just a term for a caching server closer to clients</p>
<p>In the same unrequested vein as foldable PCs, now have slidable
PCs</p>
<p>Perhaps the going through graphical ASMR programming videos the
‘enjoyable’ remedy</p>
<p>More encompassing/combined sensors, e.g. AI vision sensor, gesture
detection sensor</p>
<p>Increased power of technology, developing perhaps faster interfaces,
e.g. search by photo, speech, etc.</p>
<p>sextempber cornucopia of condoms don’t have to be nostradamus to work
out parents parking in effect, most people’s journey to learning is
bespoke my engineering mind (which has been molded by experience)
results in largely ad hoc responses many positive social dealings at
university are unfortunately pyrrhic</p>
<h1 id="news---leo-the-lion-enters-the-pride">NEWS - Leo the Lion Enters
the Pride</h1>
<p>Politics are infiltrating areas of technology: * Rust toolchains on
embedded. Rust developers have explicitly tweeted saying technology will
always be political * NASA Artemis Accords have first line stating
primary focus on women and person of colour on Moon Leads down the path
of FSF, and in fact any cultural revolution which thinks it can do
whatever it wants in the name of the people. Although perhaps ad
hominem, experience has shown that they’re all polite until they’re
not.</p>
<p>Seems in with big-tech, marketing is often more important than the
underlying technology. 170km ‘The Line’ ecotopia, metaverse, telsa etc.
They make wild claims and the general public has no way of knowing the
facts behind them (perception vs reality) A scary thought is that in
this age, possible for self-sustaining narratives capable of deflecting
facts</p>
<p>ARMs open-model allowed vendors to implement custom MPUs that saw in
gain dominance over oher RISCs like MIPS and AVR.</p>
<p>Tech companies becoming conglomerate monopolies, e.g. tiktok music,
apple tv etc.</p>
<p>Much like the C++ standards committee, concerns of ‘ivory tower’
nature of smart home Matter standards</p>
<p>Seeing consequences of covid semiconductor demand in chip shortages.
Exacerbated by increase usage in automotive industry and large
dependence on foundries in Taiwan</p>
<p>Annoyed at the web: * Seemingly lack of awareness of bloated and
abstracted infrastructure * New technologies in the sphere are just
sensationalised titles with little substance e.g. homescreen social
media, css layout model and js frameworks</p>
<p>The importance of programming to a physical machine is paramount. The
underlying technology is always changing, e.g. arcade machines,
consoles, phones, watches, plastic 4bit processors</p>
<p>EU lawmakers want USB-C for all mobile devices to reduce e-waste.

<p>Advent of more software in cars has led to subscription based
services, e.g. heated seats. However, adding software increases
complexity: * Will lack of connectivity (e.g., no cell coverage where
you’re at) mean that the features are disabled until you get back into
cell range? * Can the servers be DOS’d so that nobody’s seat heaters
work? * If I pay for a subscription and sell a car, does the
subscription stay with the car? Or will it be like Tesla’s approach,
where the new owner has to pay to unlock the software features, even if
the previous owner paid? * What if there is a bug on the server that
incorrectly reports my subscription status? Will I be refunded, fully or
partially? * What happens when you can’t get in touch with customer
support because your subscription isn’t being properly detected on the
hardware? * What happens if the hardware breaks, but you’ve paid for the
subscription? Is repair to heated seats covered under terms of the
subscription, or will that be pushed to owners? * What happens if this
strategy is used by a smaller company than BMW, who suddenly goes out of
business and bricks your otherwise perfectly working hardware due to
shutting down servers?</p>

<p>Moore’s law number of transistors doubles every 2 years. Although not
strictly true, general trend is holding. Proebsting’s law states that
compiler improvements will double program performance every 18 years.
Therefore, cautious about the performance benefits a compiler brings.

20% faster.</p>

<p>ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Turing Award is essentially
Nobel Prize for Computer Science. Not applicable for me as awards
largely for academic contributions like papers/reports published e.g

<p>Visualising essential for debugging insidious problems… Print rows of

will require memory which we will cast to appropriate state structure,
e.g. DebugState state structures will have
<code>b32 is_initialised</code> field which will initialise a memory
arena Then have CounterState and CounterSnapshot (move per frame data
into this) Each frame, copy over src to dst (with a rolling buffer) In
the rendering of the records, to display snapshots, generate statistics
like min, max, avg. These will be converged into a Statistic struct for
each value Have helper function for begin, update and end statistic with
value Now we have max, loop over again to generate graph height scale
and say red colour scale Alternatively we could have absolute height
scale, e.g <code>total / 0.033f</code> (So in drawing, will typically
have ‘raw’ structures that just have data, and will then loop over these
again to generate relationships to actually draw from etc.)</p>

<p>In reality, don’t want an RTOS if timing very critical. Most MCU
don’t even have multiple cores so adding software overhead (or are there
additional hardware to emulate cores?) Even without RTOS, will most
likely have some timer and separation of tasks. Main overall benefit of
RTOS is consistent driver interfaces across multiple mcus (useful for
say complex bluetooth/ethernet stacks etc.) Most mcus are overpowered
for what they do, so using an RTOS is probably a good idea.</p>

introduce things like CCM (core coupled cache) and ART (adaptive

(i.e. a lot more than just a CPU to be concerned with) also have more
debug hardware don’t really know why cortex-m4 has MPU</p>
<p>AXIM, AHB and APB ARM specific will have a bus matrix (which allows
different peripherals to communicate via master and slave ports by
requesting and sending data) off this, have AHB (higher frequency and
higher bandwidth). like to think of AHB as host bus as it feeds into
APBs via a bridge. APB1 normally half frequency of APB2 we can see that
DMA can go directly to APB without going through bus matrix So, relevent
for speed and clock concerns going through which bus? Also to know if we
are DMA’ing something and CPUing something, they are not going to be
fighting on the same bus, i.e. spread out load lower power peripherals
on lower frequency busses? this level of knowledge further emphasises
need to know hardware to understand what is going on</p>

(what motivations brought about these architectures?) as often harvard
archicture (why?) Von Neumann, RAM (variables, data, stack) + ROM
(code/constants) + I/O all on same CPU bus. Harvard has ICode bus for
ROM, and a SystemBus for RAM + I/O. This allows operations to occur
simultaneously. So, why use Von Neumann? it is labelled as an evaluation
board different boards use different ICDI (in-circuit debug interfaces)
to flash through SWD via usb-b e.g. texas instruments use stellaris,
stm32 ST-link is fixed point used anymore? TODO(Ryan): Why is a floating
pin also called high impedance? To avoid power dissipation and unknown
state, drive with external source, e.g. ground or voltage.</p>
<p>Pull-up/down resistors are to used for unconnected input pins to
avoid floating state So, a pull-down will have the pin (when in an
unconnected state) to ground, i.e. 0V when switch is not on</p>

<p>Don’t restrict right side of bell curve Let your aces be aces Being
an ace involves having an opinion Most influential software written

large teams. Design by committee pushes design to middle of bell curve
as opposing views average out</p>
<p>Cpu try to guess what instructions ahead (preemptive). Cost of
incorrect reflushing expensive. So want to get rid of conditional jumps.
Ideally replace with conditional movs or arithmetic branch less
techniques. Endianness (register view), twos complement (-1 all 1s)
Branch less programming is essentially SIMD</p>
<p>What simd instructions available to cpu? If variable clock speed, cpu
could detect not using all cores and increase single core clock</p>
<p>Flops calculated with best instruction set? Not memory bound is best
case for hyper threading Intel speeds optimised for gpr arithmetic,
boolean and flops Why is Intel shr instruction so slow? Intel
deliberately makes mmx slow —–</p>
<p>For intel CPUs, i3-i7 of same generation will have same
micro-architecture. Just more cache, hyperthreading, cores, die size
etc.</p>
<p>$(grub-)</p>
<p>Intel clock frequency is often changed by OS?</p>
<p>Is cortex-m4 microarchitecture? How does this relate to intel naming?
AMD also?</p>

<p>SATA ssd is the lowest grade ssd (however still 4 times

<p>storage devices: form factor (M.2 keying, PCIe), interface (SATAIII,

interfaces, so ensure motherboard has appropriate chipset</p>
<p>DRAM refreshed periodically. SDRAM (synchronises clock speed with

<p>SRAM more expensive, faster, not refreshed, larger die size.</p>
<p>DIIM (dual in-line memory module) is form factor (wider bus) SODIMM
(small outline)</p>
<p>From $(cpuinfo) see that although 64bit cpu this is just what the
instruction set supports. As we have no need for 16 exabytes (tera,
peta, exa), the physical address size may be 39bits, and virtual size
48bits to save on unused transistors</p>
<p>$(cpu-x) for cache information per core</p>
<p>NUMA node relationship between CPU socket (location on motherboard)
and memory banks. So, say 2 sockets will probably have 2 NUMA nodes.
Therefore, not all physical memory directly accessible from 1 cpu
socket; will have to go through other socket to get it</p>
<p>Hyperthreads don’t increase number of instructions per second, rather
number of instructions that can be queued (so hyperthread like a
queue)</p>
<p>Caches, are instruction and data caches combined? What distinct
features in a core, e.g. shared caches? What additional features on one
capable of hyperthreading?</p>
<p>CPU could implement VT-x, but motherboard and bios must support this
as well? What additional features are present when CPU supports
this?</p>
<p>Cache probably 8-way as compromise between lookup and copy speed.
Flow of cache, is it check if from 8-way copy then L2 8-way or finish L1
entirely? If found, in L2 does it copy to L1?</p>
<p>Polymorphism is a single object that can be interpreted as having
various types. This can simply be a struct with unions and a type
field.</p>
<p>Never use setters/getters unless actually doing something. You’re
spending your entire day typing. If needing, replace variable name with
name_ to see where it was used.</p>
<p>You need to be self critical to be a good engineer</p>
<p>Caches are a way of minimising roundtrip time of RAM by putting
memory as close to the core that thinks will need it L1 closest, 1/2
cycles, 32k. Wikichip for more info Cpu will go to caches first</p>
<p>L1 can supply 2 cache lines per clock Instructions per clock, number
of work components, e.g. number of add components, cache line per
cycles, cache latency, agu (address resolver units) impose restrictions
A cache miss is simply stalling for an instruction. However, this may
not be an issue if we do other work, e.g. complex algorithm takes many
instructions hiding memory access for out of order cpu. If hyper
threading with two schedulers, if cache miss on one, just switch to the
other. Can really only know if a cache miss incurs a performance penalty
by looking at raw numbers from vtune, etc. Because of the scheduler,
it’s not as simple as just looking at memory sizes So, due to complex
overlapped/scheduling nature of modern CPUs can really only know if
cache miss incurs penalty with vtune Uop website displays table for
instructions</p>
<p>Currently good that most things are little endian with 64 byte cAche
lines, however some hardware guys Is going to come along and change it
back to big endian</p>
<p>Should be code of ethics in software to not create
bugs/inconveniences for users that couldve been avoided</p>
<p>An instruction of throughput 1 means issued every clock. As many
instructions take longer than 1 cycle, each core requires a scheduler to
see if it can execute something. View cpu as sections where there is
some distance to communicate.</p>
<p>Making some thing good takes time. However, if you have crazy design
practices it will also take longer You have to be reality based when
programming. That is in an engineering sense, to design something that
solves the problem you have People become attached to a way of
programming which doesn’t focus on solving the problem. They want to
build rube-goldberg machines Selectively attacking problems seriously
means you have a functional program quicker, whereby you can actually
decide if those other problems need to be addressed. Can defer hard
decisions later as they will be made better as you will have more
technical expertise and more context to work with</p>
<p>Testing is important. If you don’t write tests, your software doesn’t
work. However, write higher level system tests, not excessive unit
tests. More efficient and this is where bugs are likely to be. You often
have to remove code, so having unit tests just increases the volume of
code you have to write. Huge drain on productivity. Maybe for NASA. A
new paradigm should weigh up cost-benefit. Almost always the cost is
ignored and people gobble them up</p>
<p>To make computers better to use, have to simplify them on all
levels</p>
<p>Faster cpu like Apple’s m1 are irrelevant if software bad</p>
<p>Floating point math faster than integers</p>
<p>my style of programming and problems enjoy solving found in embedded,
e.g your constrained with the silicon not like in web where you just
build another data centre</p>
<p>Compiler works on file by file, so knows nothing about calls across
files. Therefore it generates object files which are partially
executable machine code with unresolved symbols. Linker merges these
object files and also adds extra header information so that the OS can
load our executable (or more specifically a kernel, e.g. linux)</p>
<p>Complete code coverage on the one hand is very thorough, however
don’t get a lot of engineering output. Furthermore, most bugs appear in
between systems not in units.</p>
<p>Best way to test is to release on early access. This checks hardware
and software, user may be running adobe acrobat which hogs cpu so
instruct them to kill it before running your game. Or maybe 20000 chrome
plugins. This is something a hardware lab can’t tell you</p>
<p>Process is allocated virtual memory space OS has mapping table that
converts these to physical addresses. Part of our processes address
space is pre-populated by the kernel program loader, e.g.  linux-vdso,
environment variables, etc. Kernel tunables: sudo sh -c ‘echo
kernel.perf_event_paranoid=0 &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf’ (sysctl)
User tunables: ulimit -a In virtual address space, have user space and
kernel space address ranges. A virtual address is mostly relating to
page table indexes and the last bit is a static offset (as for security
addresses are randomized)</p>
<p>To make an installer just fwrite your executable and then data files
appended with footer. Inside the exe, fread the exe and fseek based on
the static offset of the appended resources Bake resources in for
reliability only really</p>
<p>Packed files better as less OS operations performing expensive file
handles etc.</p>
<p>Programming about solving problem. overlooked by design philosophies.
If you don’t have any functionality, you don’t have a structural
problem</p>
<p>const is only useful if you find it catches bugs for you (maybe for
globals instead of using #defines) however, in terms of optimsations,
const is useless as you can cast const away. therefore, for me, const is
mostly just a waste of typing.</p>
<p>distinct areas of memory in assembly are stack, heap and data
(globals)</p>
<p>direction of stack growth is often determined by CPU. if selectable,
then OS. eg. x86 is downwards ulimit -s for stack size</p>
<p>good practice to assign variable for syntatical reasons, i.e. more
readable, e.g Controller *controller =
&amp;evdev_input_device.controller;</p>
<p>getconf can list POSIX system configurable variables</p>
<p>don’t go through a ton of unecessary stdlib. malloc probably more
optimised for small memory size requests relative to overall code base,
interfacing with system calls is not that much code (and can be
reused)</p>
<p>if we try to access memory from an invalid page (not reserved or
comitted) will get segfault. only have to worry about errors that don’t
manifest themselves on every run of the program.</p>
<p>on x86, writing by 32bit faster than 8bit as less instructions in
general, the fastest way is to use the widest possible register that can
be operated on at once the speed of accessing the memory from cache is
pretty cheap for nearby regions</p>
<p>don’t make changes for conceptual cleanliness. end of the day, want
to make performant, bug free code in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<p>when programming some days you are off. this just means you’re going
to be debugging a lot</p>
<p>we want it to be clear what our code can and cannot touch. global
variables make this hard (however, can add _ to see where they are all
used) however, as many OSs are rather janky and most code will live
outside this, it is ok to have some globals here globals are fine in
development. can repackage into a structure later.</p>
<p>clock speed not as relevent as improvements in microarchitecture and
number of cores means can be more efficient under less duress. also,
lower clock speed may be because want to draw less power.</p>
<p>short build times (under 10 seconds) are incredibly important to not
decentivness making changes and testing them</p>
<p>function overloading, generalised operator overloading and default
arguments are c++ features that can’t easily be implemented with gcc
extensions</p>
<p>note that &gt;&gt; will typically (implementation defined) perform
arithmetic shift (fill in with 1’s) on signed, so not always the same as
a divide. similarly, sign-extension just fills in the new MSBs with
1’s</p>
<p>for large cross-platform projects, best to differentiate with
filenames, rather than ifdefs. this also gives the ability to have
different control flows across the different platforms (essential)</p>
<p>for a game, better to have the game as a service to the OS (not the
other way round). this is becuase the game does not need to know/perform
the myriad of possible operations the OS can perform.</p>
<p>most modern cpus have a floating point unit, making them faster than
ints (same latency), e.g. a multiply is one instruction where ints is
two (multiply and shift) x87 is the FPU instructions for x86 (also have
SSE instructions which is want you ultimately want) however, for
multiplayer games, optimisers can give different results when using
floating point, e.g a platform that has operator fusion like a MULADD
may give different result when rounding then a platform that has do it
separate. (fixed point could solve this)</p>
<p>Programming Mentality: always important to know when coding what is
your goal. premature optimisation and design are bad. your goal
dictactes the quality of the code you write, e.g. allowed to be janky as
first pass on API. write usage code first.</p>
<p>often when having a variable lengthed array, ask ourselves do we
really need that?</p>
<p>asserts are part of debug program that are used to check that things
work that should always work. use them for a condition that must be true
that is not explicitly present</p>
<p>don’t think about memory management, but rather memory usage. if
having to worry about freeing etc. done something wrong.</p>
<p>when writing ‘spec’ code, no need to handle all cases; simply note
down the edge cases you should handle later on stop yourself thinking
about whether the code is messy or not. only care once problem is
solved!</p>
<p>it’s not the programming practice but the dogma that gets you. when
you start to name things it almost always becomes bad. almost all
programming practices have a place, just not used often so RAII people,
in case of things that must be released, e.g DeviceContext, ok to use a
constructor/destructor pair. I’ll throw you a bone there</p>
<p>streaming i/o is almost never a good choice (hard drive slowest, more
errors)</p>
<p>compression orientated programming is you code what you need at the
time (breaking out into function, combining into struct, etc.) over time
the code marches towards a better overall quality</p>
<p>amdahls law gives the time taken for execution given a number of
cogives the time taken for execution given a number of cores. for this
formula (indeed any formula) we can obtain some property by seeing as
function parameter approaches infinity. in this case, the parallelising
part drops out. brooks law says that simply adding more people to a
problem does not necessarily make it faster. if requires great deal of
coordination/communication actually slows down.</p>
<p>solving a problem: 1. decide what you are doing (this can’t be
open-ended.) 2. organise groups to achieve this by making these
boundaries, we are presupposing that each part is separate, e.g tyres
team and engine team; assume tyres and engine cannot be one piece.
therefore, the boundaries define what products you can make, i.e. you
produce products that are copies of yourself or how you are structured
so, in software if we assign teams for say audio, 2d, 3d we would expect
individual APIs for each. the org chart is the asymptote, so it’s the
best case that we make a product as granular as our org chart. it could
be far worse and even more granular therefore, communication between
teams is more costly than communication within teams. takeaway is that
low-cost things can be optimised, high-cost can’t be (further away on
the org chart) note that communication in code could just be someone
checking something in and you pulling it what we are seeing now with
modern software is the superposition of orgcharts due to use of legacy
codebases now we see org charts in software, where people are
artifically creating inheritence hierarcies that limit how the program
works this is very bad. the reason it’s done is for people to create
mental models that help them solve the problem as they can’t keep the
complexity in their head. it may be necesary to solve the problem,
however it shouldn’t be looked at as good. however, because it’s done
due to lack of understanding, the delegation/separation is not done with
enough information. so you limit possibilities of the design space. so
although, libraries, microservices, encapsulation, package managers,
engines may be necessary due to our brain capacity (until neuralink or
we figure out a better way to do them) they are not good! we may use
hash map, but only in a particular way They limit optimisation as we
have already decided separation so always be on the lookout for times
when you don’t have to do these most people just download hundreds of
libraries because they know it works and they won’t be worse than any
one else. WE MUST BE LEAN AND FLEXIBLE IN ORGCHARTS IN COMPANY AND IN
SOFTWARE TO INCREASE DESIGN. some old codebases need to be retired</p>
<p>DO THE ‘MOST CERTAIN’ THING FIRST. THIS COULD EITHER BE THE
IMPLEMENTATION OR THE USAGE CODE choose data structures around solving
problem</p>
<p>some software is scaffolding, i.e. not shipped with the final
product, e.g. editor for games</p>
<p>To make anything alternate over time, just multiply by
sine(time);</p>
<p>Data hiding hides what the CPU is doing, which is what we care
about</p>
<p>Require machine-specific documentation files to understand system we
are on System specific ctags template projects, e.g. linux kernel,
glibc, etc. If using library, have ctags for that project</p>
<p>ALMOST ALWAYS CAST TO FLOAT WHEN DOING DIVISIONS LEADING TO FLOAT</p>
<p>Minimum value starts at max</p>
<p>Spreading out randomness:
<code>final_value += contrib * sample</code></p>
<p>If debug code (or code that will not be in release) use compile-time
macros</p>
<p>Use GLOBAL and global_prefix If casting is occuring, always be
explicit about it! Prefixing functions with sdl2_func() or linux_func()
only if intending to be cross-platform</p>
<p>With error handling, bad practice is to allow a lot of errors, which
brings in error classes etc. Instead, if it’s something that is actually
an error, e.g. missing file, write the code to explicitly handle it.
Handling the error in a sense makes it no longer an error, rather a
feature of the program</p>
<p>if function is expecting a range between, should we clamp to it?</p>
<p>Refactoring Mentality: Refactoring is essential. You must know what
you are trying to achieve so you have some notion of progress,
e.g. adding a constraint to the system. (Replacing variable type in
scope gives us all locations where variable was used, including macros.
This us where dynamic lnguages fail as you don’t know if you broke
something)</p>
<p>You can abstract/encapsulate anything at anytime, so why not do it
later when you know what you are doing? We want file format to be simple
and binary, unlike json which is general purpose and string</p>
<p>modifying (parse as pointer arg), returning (result struct). it is
best to put simple types are arguments rather than a group struct to
allow for maximum code reuse. only put group struct as arguments if must
be put together (in general don’t pack so don’t force user to create a
struct when they may already have the values)</p>
<p>if can go functional without sacrificing, saves you complexity down
the road. oftentimes simply utilising elements of functional programming
is good, e.g. no global state, only operating on parameters etc.</p>
<p>writing code guides you to the right design, e.g. made same call
-&gt; put into function; require args in function -&gt; struct; many
related functions together -&gt; organise related functions into own
file; (if thinking could be moved to another file, make comment sections
outlining code blocks to ease this process later on) etc. (these are
simple, compression changes), complex api -&gt; transient struct,
overload functions for internal/external use There are also large
changes that are more difficult, e.g.  sections of single value
interpreted differently -&gt; pack 2 variables into 1 (_ technique
useful here) same operations performed on pairs of variables -&gt;
vectors (as oppose to working with them as scalars) vectors are
particularly useful as without them repeated actions quickly become
intractable It can get messy at times, but always know that a clean
solution is out there and you will refine towards it Work threw the
error tree one at a time Important to throw in asserts for underlying
assumptions. Also for debugging be aware of ‘copy-pasta’, e.g. copying
variables will have same name for two parameters as didn’t replace
it</p>
<p>we don’t want to orient our code around objects (if anything,
algorithmic oriented). its about how you arrive at some code that
determines how good it is</p>
<p>excessive pre-planning and setting waypoints is really only useful if
you’ve done the problem before (which in that case you’re not really
designing) instead, we become a good pathfinder, learning to recognise
the gradient of each day of the journey. when write the simplest thing
and loft it out into good design later (in this explorative phase, if we
make an changes for efficiency reasons we have just introduced the
possibilities of bugs with no benefit)</p>
<p>only break into function when you know what you want, e.g. called
multiple times or code finalised and improved readability (in which case
a tradeoff is made between understanding functionality and
semantics)</p>
<p>Don’t be scared of mass name changing!! Before doing so, see all
places where name is used Don’t be scared of long list of compiler
errors. Work your way through them</p>
<p>Refactoring with usage code: just write out structures that satisfy
the usage code. If major rewrite use #if 0 #endif to allow for
successful compiling</p>
<p>refactoring just copy code into function that gets it to compile.
later, worry about passing information in as a parameter basic debug and
release compiler flags When refactoring, utilise our vimrc <C-F> all
files Also, just pull code out into desired function and let the
compiler errors guide you Returning multiple values, just return struct
To reduce large number of function parameters, put into struct</p>
<p>Debugging Mentality: debugging stepping through pass-by-pass.
inspecting all variables and parameters and verifying state of
particular ones. make deductions about state of variables, e.g
overflowed, uninitialised, etc. drop in asserts draw it out</p>
<p>being able to draw out debug information is very useful. time spent
visualising is never wasted (in debugger expressions also)</p>
<p>When debugging, look through variables and see if anything looks
ridiculous</p>
<p>When in debugger, go iteratively progress through variable values in
function and see if they look right We can isolate some area of the code
and say this is probably the problem Then investigate relevent
sub-functions, etc. This can be a long process with seemingly little
gains. The issue could be subtle, e.g. signed/unsignedness size,
function called rarely</p>
<p>Configuration files should be copied, not generated (becomes too
messy) Symlink to template files from projects</p>
<p>To begin, I ensured that I had a debugger from which I could easily
step through the application’s execution. In code, I was able to
programmatically set system and user breakpoints.</p>
<p>(mocking of syscalls for unit testing with file i/o)</p>
<p>For handling non-fatal errors, single line check. For fatal errors,
nest all preceding code (I have learnt to not be afraid of indentation
in this manner). (error handling in general, i.e. reduce ‘errors’ by
making them part of normal execution flow)</p>
<p>When performing the common task of grouping data, a few practices to
keep in mind. Use fixed sized types to always know about struct padding
(in fact, I like to extend this to all my code)</p>
<p>If wanting multiple ways of accessing grouped data, use union and
anonymous structs. Use an int to reference other structs,
e.g. <code>plane_index</code></p>
<p>If the data being grouped can only exist together (e.g. points), use
vectors. Put all structs related typedefs inside their own header file
for easy access.</p>
<p>As floats are an approximation, when comparing to 0.0f (say for a
denominator check) or negative (say for a square root) use a
tolerance/epsilon less-than/greater-than check. In fact whenever
dividing should always ask oneself “can the value be zero?” To be clear
about float to int casting, use a macro like truncate/round (think about
what if uneven divide) Due to mixed integer and float arithmetic going
to float, calculate integer percentages <code>val * 100 / total</code>
There is no need to overload the division operator as can do
<code>(* 1.0f / val)</code></p>
<p>For easy substitution, use single letter prefix names like
<code>output_h</code> and <code>output_w</code>. Convention for variable
arrays, e.g. <code>Planes plane[1]</code>, <code>planes</code> and
<code>plane_count (use ARRAY_COUNT macro here)</code> Put for loop
statements on separate line to help not be afraid of indentation.
Iterate over pixel space and then convert to say, world space for
calculations (normalisation and lerp) Aspect ratio correction is simply
rearranging a ratio. If we determine one side is larger, scale other.
Use “ ASCII code to print a status indicator. Only use const for char *
string literals stored in the data segment.</p>
<p>Endianness comes into play when reading/writing from disk (e.g. file
type magic value) and working directly with <code>u8 *</code>
(e.g. iterating through bytes of a u32)</p>
<p>time -p; getrusage();</p>
<p>Can pin a thread to a core</p>
<p>Can run programs in kernel space with eBPF</p>
<p>Frequent context-switching will give terrible cache coherency</p>
<p>adding <code>restrict</code> also useful to prevent aliasing and
thereby might allow compiler to vectorise say array loops</p>
<p>Before cpus increased in single thread execution speed. Now more
cores. It’s a topic of research to convert single threaded into
multithreaded for emulation. This is why emulation of something like the
GameCube (powerpc) is slow. Furthermore, due to hardware irregularities
that programs relied on may take hundreds of instructions to emulate If
actually a simple translation, then should run close to native speed.
This is reality of emulating hardware with hardware</p>
<p>CISC gives reduced cache pressure for high-intensive, sustained
loops</p>

https://zeux.io/2020/01/22/learning-from-data/</p>
<p>Cpu try to guess what instructions ahead (preemptive). Cost of
incorrect reflushing expensive. So want to get rid of conditional jumps.
Ideally replace with conditional movs or arithmetic branch less
techniques. Endianness (register view), twos complement (-1 all 1s)
Branch less programming is essentially SIMD</p>
<p>If variable clock speed, cpu could detect not using all cores and
increase single core clock</p>
<p>Not memory bound is best case for hyper threading Intel speeds
optimised for GPR arithmetic, boolean and flops Intel deliberately makes
mmx slow</p>
<p>Low cache associativity means fast lookup but a lot of misses and
thus eviction policy like LRU</p>
<p>Count cycles to counteract possible thermal throttling Hyperthreads
useful only if different execution unit Cpu reads memory from cache and
ram in cache lines (due to programmer access patterns). Each item in
cache set is cache line size</p>
<p>if apple computers use RISC ARM in M1, why CISC necessary? (only
because on Intel?) emphasis of CISC simplify assembly (e.g. more
addressing modes), thereby reducing size of binary? (reduce
instructions) and increase cache coherency RISC will require less
transistors to implement complex hardware but will make optimising
harder for compiler? single cycle instructions (reduce cycles per
instruction)</p>
<p>when looking at a pointer, to optimise compiler must know whether it
can assume it points to a local var or not. so, easier to eliminate
aliasing with non-pointers</p>
<p>when viewing from application in a sandboxed environment like a
phone, total RAM less than installed as portion reserved for kernel</p>
<p>simplistically RAM 50ns and HDD 10µs? faster to read than write</p>
<p>2.5bln * 8 (simd) * n (execution units) * 2 (cores) assuming
instructions have throughput of 1 so 64 / 4 gives how many floats per
second from L1 cache in general, not streaming from memory the entire
time (would probably hit a cache bandwidth limit)</p>
<p>// undefined behaviour if not true ALWAYS_INLINE void assume(bool

<p>Unless your in web where everything takes years to load, as single
threaded performance is largely stagnant you will have to utilise
parallelism if want performance. This is very difficult and like single
threaded code generic libraries which can actually be very specific will
create bloated in performing code based. Multithreading is building up a
new discipline to single threaded. There are a lot of pitfalls for
performance (balancing want things local, however must share to utilise)
If you care about performance for anything, you should care about cache
misses Memory bandwidth and caches are major reasons for a cup attaining
performance. You have to think about where does memory actually live and
how is it transferred around</p>
<p>Optimiser allows for lexical scoping of stack variables. However, for
optimiser to inline will have to get rid of pointers to prevent
aliasing</p>
<p>stack and heap memory are the same physical thing, so only more
efficient if memory was hot, i.e. recently touched</p>
<p>Computer faster than you think, e.g instructions, clock cycles,
cores. Very large With M2 drive should be quick</p>
<p>may be easier for optimising compiler to work with things passed by
value as oppose to pointer. so, if need to modify something may have to
return the value in a functional programming style. however, this is
error prone. compiler cannot optimise pointers, e.g. if setting two
values to same pointer, compiler cannot say that both the values are the
same as another pointer may point to the same address. this is
aliasing.</p>
<p>we see contiguous memory in virtual memory, however in physical
memory it is almost certainly going to be fragmented</p>
<p>compilers can auto-vectorize loops for us (and other operations if we
perform say 20 of them). so, floats will be twice as fast as doubles
(more space, even though same latency and throughput)</p>
<p>optimising is a very precise process. only do when you have code that
is working and you know will keep. games by their very nature are about
responsiveness, so optimisation and low-latency is important. I like
programming with this as a mentality.</p>
<p>with pure compiler optimisations, i.e. code we have not optimised
ourselves, a 2x increase is not unexpected. (code we optimised not as
much)</p>
<p>optimise for worst case (looking out on whole world) not best case
(in front of wall, don’t render what is behind). we care about highest
framerate, not lowest.</p>
<p>virtually never use lookup tables as ram memory is often 100x slower
(so unless you can’t compute in 100 of instructions)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Optimisation (this is rarely done due to time involved) Do
back-of-envelope calculations; look at algorithm to see if wasteful;
benchmark to see if hitting theoretical calculations and then use
timings etc. to isolate why our code isn’t hitting these theoretical
numbers Very importantly need to know what the theoretical maximum is,
which will be dependent on the program, e.g bounded by number of bytes
sent to graphics card, kernel stdout etc.</li>
<li>Non-pessimisation (do this all the time) Don’t introduce unecessary
work (interpreter; complex libraries; constructs like
polymorphism/classes people have convinced themselves are necessary) for
the CPU to do to solve the problem</li>
<li>Fake optimisation (very bad philosophy) Repeating context-specific
statements e.g. use memcpy as it’s optimised (however the speed of
something is so context specific, so non-statement), arrays are faster
than linked lists (again, so dependent on what your usage patterns
are)</li>
</ol>
<p>When many people say too much effort involved in optimisation, they
are generally thinking of point 1</p>
<p>sometimes things should be running faster than they should, however
only so much we can replace e.g. the structure of many OSs are based on
legacy code, so simply outputting to stdout may go through shell then
kernel etc. also, may have to deal with pessimised libraries. in these
cases: * isolate bad code, i.e. draw hard boundary between your code and
theirs by caching calls to them * do as little modification to the data
coming in from them (no need to say put in a string class etc.)</p>
<p>People think that it’s slow, but it won’t crash (because of
interpreter) Performance is critical in getting people excited about
what you do, e.g. windows ce was laggy, iphone performant but less
features changes the market low latency is more desirable, even if less
features</p>
<p>count number of math ops in function and control flow logic that is
evaluated branches can get problematic if they’re unpredictable</p>
<p>inspecting measurements of microarchitecture consider latency and
throughtput (how much does it cost to start again) so, FMUL may have
latency of 11, however throughput of 0.5, so can start 2 every cycle,
i.e. issue again (cpus these days are incredibly overlapped even if
single-threaded) so throughput is more of what we care about for
sustained execution, e.g. in a loop</p>
<p>however, these numbers are all assuming the data is in the chip. it’s
just as important to see how long it takes to get data to the chip. look
at cache parameters for microarchitecture; how many cycles to get from
l1 cache, l2 cache, etc. when get to main memory potentially hundreds of
cycles</p>
<p>bandwidth of L1 cache say is 80 bytes/cycle, so can get 20 floats per
cycle (however, based on size of L1 cache, not really sustainable for
large data)</p>
<p>http://igoro.com/archive/gallery-of-processor-cache-effects/</p>
<p>(could just shortcut this and just see if flops is recorded for our
chip)</p>
<p>so, using these rough numbers we should be able to look at an
algorithm (and dissect what operations it’s performing, like FMULs),
know how much data it’s taking, and give a rough estimate as to how long
it could optimally take (will never hit optimal however) IT’S CRITICAL
TO KNOW HOW FAST SOMETHING SHOULD RUN</p>
<p>REASONS SOFTWARE IS SLOW: 1. No back-of-envelope calculations (people
aren’t concerned that they are running up to 1000 times slower thn what
the hardware is capable of) These calculations involve say looking at
number of math ops to be performed in the algoirthm and comparing that
to the perfect hardware limit 2. Reusing code (20LOC is a lot; use
things that do what you want to do, but not in the way you want them to
be done; often piling up code that is ill-fitting to what the task was,
e.g. we know this isn’t a regular ray cast, it’s a ray cast that is
always looking down) 3. When writing, thinking of goals ancillary to
task (not many places taught how to actually write code; all high level
abstractions about clean code there are thinking about templates/classes
etc. not just what does the computer actually have to do to do this
task?) (there is no metric for clean code; it’s just some fictional
thing people made up)</p>
<p>WHENEVER UNDERSTANDING CODE EXAMPLES: 1. COMPILE AND STEP INTO (NOT
OVER) IN DEBUGGER AND MAKE HIGH LEVEL STEPS PERFORMED look at these
steps for duplicated/unecessary work (may pollute cache). (perhaps even
asking why was the code written the way it was) could we gather things
up in a prepass, i.e. outside of loop? if allocating memory each cycle
that’s game over for performance. do we actually have to perform the
same action to get the same result, e.g. a full raycast is not
necessary, just segment on grid O(n·m) is multiplicative, not linear
O(n). big oh is just indication of how it scales. could be less given
some input threshold now, once code reduced, look at minimising number
of ops</p>
<p>cpu front end is figuring out what work it has to do,
i.e. instruction decoding</p>
<p>e.g simd struct is 288 bytes, 4.5 cache lines, able to store 8
triangles</p>
<p>understanding assembly language is essential in understanding why the
code might not be performing well</p>
<p>branch prediction necessary to ensure that the front-end can keep
going and not have to wait on the back-end</p>
<p>execution ports execute uops. however, the days of assembly language
registers actually mapping to real registers is gone. instead, the
registers from the uops are passed through a register allocation table
(if we have say 16 general purpose registers, table has about 192
entries; so a lot more) in the back-end this is because in many
programs, things can happen in any order. so to take advantage of this,
the register allocation table stores dependency chains of operations
(wikichips.org for diagram) from execution port, could be fed back into
scheduler or to load/store in actual memory</p>
<p>when looking at assembly, when we say from memory, we actually mean
from the L1 cache</p>
<p>xmm is a sse register (4 wide, 16 bytes); m128 is a memory operand of
128 bits ymm is 8 wide 1<em>p01 + 1</em>p23 is saying issue 1 microop on
either port0 or port1 and one microop on either port2 or port3 so, we
could issue the same instruction multiple times, i.e. throughput of
0.5</p>
<p>microop fusion is where a microop doesn’t count for your penalty as
it’s fused with another. with combined memory ops,
e.g. <code>vsubps ymm8, ymm3, ymmword ptr [rdx]</code> this is the case
so, if a compiler were to separate this out into a mov and then a sub,
not only does this put unecessary strain on the front-end decoder it
also removes microop fusion as they are now separate microops (important
to point out that I’m not the world best optimiser, or the worlds best
optimisers assistant, so perhaps best not to outrightly say bad codegen,
just say makes nervous)</p>
<p>godbolt.org good for comparing compiler outputs and possible
detecting a spurious load etc.</p>
<p>macrop fusion is where you have an instruction that the front-end
will handle for you, e.g. add and a jne will merge to addjne which will
just send the 1 microp of add through</p>
<p>uica.uops.info gives percentage of time instruction was on a port
(this is useful for determining bottle-necks, e.g. series of
instructions all require port 1 and 2, so cannot paralleise easily) so,
although best case say is issue instruction every 4 cycles, this
bottleneck will give higher throughput</p>
<p>some levels of abstraction are necessary and good, e.g. higher level
languages to assembly</p>

<p>recording information: We want to understand where slow with vtune,
amd uprof, arm performance reports Next, determine if IO bound, memory
bound etc.</p>
<p>To determine performance must have some stable metric, e.g. ops/sec
to compare to e.g measure total time and number of operations
Hyper-threading useful in alleviating memory latency, e.g. one thread is
waiting to get content from RAM, the other hyper-thread can execute
However, as we are not memory bound (just going through pixel by pixel
and not generating anything intermediate; will all probably stay in L1
cache), we are probably saturating the core’s ALUs, so hyper-threading
not as useful</p>
<p>Inspecting the assembly of our most expensive loop, we see that
rand() is not inlined and is a call festival. This must be replaced
Essentially we are looking for mathematical functions that could be
inlined and aren’t that are in our hot-path. When you want something to
be fast, it should not be calling anything. If it does, probably made a
mistake Also note that using SIMD instructions, however not to their
widest extent, i.e. single scalar ‘ss’. Want to replace with ‘ps’ packed
scalar</p>
<p>we have the option of constructor/destructor pairs if we want to
determine best possible time if all caches align etc. ‘hunt for
mininum’, e.g. record mininum time execution in loop iteration or re-run
if smaller time yielded alternatively, we could develop a statistical
breakdown of values (could see moments when kernel switches us out
etc.)</p>
<p>(IMPORTANT save out configuration and timing information for various
optimisation stages, e.g. ./app &gt; 17-04-2022-image.txt)</p>
<p>agnerfog optimise website ‘what’s a creel’</p>
<p>threading Observe CPU percentage use is not close to 100% For
multithreading, often have to pack into 64 bit value to perform single
operation on it,
e.g. <code>delta = (val1 &lt;&lt; 32 | val2); interlocked_add(&amp;val, delta)</code></p>
<p>When making multi-threaded, segregate task by writing prototype
‘chunk’ function, e.g. <code>render_tile</code> Then write a for loop
combining these chunk functions Before entering the chunk function, good
to have a configuration printout, e.g. num chunks, num cores, chunk dim,
chunk size, etc.</p>
<p>When dividing a whole into pieces, an uneven divisor will give less
than what’s needed. so <code>(total + divisor - 1) / divisor</code> to
ensure always enough. We will want this calculation to be in the last
dividing operation, e.g. tile_width then tile_count calculated, so use
on tile_count Associated with this calculation is clamping to handle
adding extra exceeding original dimensions For getting proper place in
chunk, call function wrapper for pointer location per row</p>
<p>(May have to inline functions?) Next we want to pass each chunk onto
a queue and then dequeue them from each logical core? So, have a
WorkOrder that will store all information required to perform operation
on chunk, i.e. all parameters in <code>render_chunk</code> function (may
also store entropy for each chunk, i.e. random number series) Then a
WorkQueue that contains an array of WorkOrders with total number
equalling number of chunks So, the original loop iterating of chunks now
just populates the WorkOrders Now in a while loop that runs while there
are still chunks to execute, we call the <code>render_chunk</code>
function and pass in the WorkQueue The <code>render_chunk</code>
function will increment the next_work_order_index and return true if
more to be done</p>
<p>When spawning the actual worker thread functions, have same while
loop calling the <code>render_chunk</code> function as for core 0 (the
amount of threads to spawn would think should be equal to number of
logical cores? however exceeding them may increase performance?) (this
debate of manually prescribing the core count applies to the chunk size
as well. perhaps the sweet-spot for my machine in balancing context
switching and drain out is to manually prescribe their size as oppose to
computing them off the core count) (Collating information into the
WorkQueue struct helsp for printing out configuration) (Setting up this
way, we can easily turn multithreading off)</p>
<p>As creating threads will require platform specific, put prototypes in
main.h and the implementations in linux_main.cpp Then include
linux_main.cpp based on macro definition of platform in the build script
at the bottom of main.cpp</p>
<p>hyperthreading, architecture specific information becomes more
important when in a situation where memory is constrained in relation to
the cache (hyper-threads share same L1-L2 cache)</p>
<p>volatile says code other than what is generated by this compiler run,
could modify this value. it’s required for multithreaded, as compiler
may not re-read value that it may have cached in a register if changed
elsewhere when incrementing volatiles, must use a
locked_add_and_return_previous_value (could return new value, just be
clear)</p>
<p>simd clamp can be re-written as min() and max() combination, which
are instructions in SSE Although looking at the system monitor shows
cpus maxed out, we could be wasting cycles, e.g. not using SIMD</p>
<p>Define lane width, and divide with this to get the new loop count Go
through loop and loft used values e.g. lane_r32, lane_v3, lane_u32
(IMPORTANT at first we are only concerned with getting single values to
work, later can worry about n-wide loading of values) (TODO the current
code has the slots for each lane generated, rather than unpacked. look
at handmade hero for this unpacking mode) If parameters to functions,
loft them also (not functions? just parameters? however we do
random_bilateral_lane() so yes to functions?) If using struct or struct
member references, take out values and loft them also,
e.g. sphere.radius == lane_r32 sphere_r; (group struct remappings
together) Remap if statement conditions into a lane_u32 mask and remove
enclosing brace hierarchy (IMPORTANT you can still have if statements if
they apply to lanes, e.g. if mask_is_zeroed() break;) (TODO for
mask_is_zeroed() we want the masks to be either all 1’s or 0’s) (call
mask_is_zeroed() on all masks to early out as often as possible to get a
speed up) Once lofted all if statements, &amp; all the masks into a
single mask (it seems if there is large amounts of code inside the if
statements, you don’t want to do it this way and rather check if needing
to execute?) (IMPORTANT to only &amp; dependent masks, e.g. if there is
an intermediate if like a pick_mask or clamp, then don’t include it, but
do the conditional assign directly on this mask) Then enclose remaining
assignments in a conditional assignment function using this single mask?
(conditional_assign(&amp;var, final_mask, value); this uses positive
mask to get source and negative mask to get dest?) (also discover the
work around to perform binary operations on floating point numbers) So,
by end of this all values operated upon should be a lane type? (can have
some scalar types if appropriate) We may have situation where some items
in a lane may finish before others. So, introduce a lane_mask variable
that indicates this. To indicate say a break, we can do (lane_mask =
lane_mask &amp; (hit_value == 0)); For incrementing, will have to
introduce an incrementor value that will be zeroed out for the
appropriate lane item that has finished. Have horizontal_add()? Next
once everything remapped create a lane.h. Here, typedef the lane types
to their single variants to ensure working before adding actual simd
instructions Also do simd helper functions like horizontal_add(),
mask_is_zeroed() in one dimension first Wrap the single lane helper
functions and types in an if depending on the lane width set (IMPORTANT
any functions that we are to SIMD, place here. if it comes that we want
actual scalar, then rename with func_lane prefix)</p>
<p>for simd typically have to organically transition from AOS to SOA</p>
<p>Debug in single lane, single threaded mode (easier and debugger
works) However, can increase lane width as needed (threading not so
much?)</p>
<p>For bitwise SIMD instructions, the compiler does not need to know how
we are segmenting the register, e.g. 4x8, 8x8 etc. as the same result is
obtained performing on the entire register at once. So they only provide
one version of it, i.e. no epi32 only si128 Naming convention have
types: <code>__m128 (float), __m128i (integer), __m128d (double)</code>
and names in functions:
<code>epi32/si128 (integer), ps (float), pd (double)</code> Overload
operators on actual wide lane structs (IMPORTANT remember to do both
orders, e.g. (val / scalar) and (scalar / val)) Also have conversion
functions</p>
<p>Lane agnostic functions go at bottom (like +=, -=, &amp;=, most v3
functionality) (IMPORTANT it seems we can replace logical &amp;&amp; and
|| with binary for same functionality in simd)</p>
<p>(IMPORTANT simd does not handle unsigned conversions, may have to cut
off sign bit, e.g. &gt;&gt; 1)</p>
<p>process of casting type to pointer to access individual bytes or
containing elements (used in file reading too)</p>
<p>(IMPORTANT masks in SIMD will either be all 1’s or 0’s. perhaps have
a specific name for this to distinguish?)</p>
<p>(IMPORTANT seems that not all operations are provided in SSE, like
!=, so have to implement with some bitwise operations)</p>
<p>SIMD allows divide by zeros by default? (because nature of SIMD have
to allow divide by zeroes?)</p>
<p>To get over the fact that C doesn’t allow &amp; floating point,
reinterpret bit paradigm <code>*(u32 *)&amp;a</code> as oppose to cast
(IMPORTANT in SIMD cast is reinterpreting bits, so the opposite of cast
in C)</p>
<p>caching https://akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf 1. know cache sizes
to have data fit in it 2. know cache line sizes to ensure data is close
together (may have to separate components of structs to allow loops to
access less cache lines) i.e. understand what you operate on frequently.
may also have to align struct 3. simple, linear access patterns (or
prefetch instructions) for things larger than cache size</p>
<p>inline assembly (raw syscalls from github) HAVE TO INSPECT/VERIFY
ASSEMBLY IS SANE FIRST THEN LOOK AT TIMING INFORMATION inspecting
compiler generated assembly loops, look for JMP to ascertain looping
condition due to macro-op fusion (relevent to say Skylake), e.g. cmp-jmp
non-programmable instructions could be executed by the cpu similarly,
instructions that only exist on the frontend but exist programmatically
e.g. xmm to xmm might just be a renaming in register allocation table
also due to concurrent port usage, can identify parts of code as
relatively ‘free’ struct access typically off a [base pointer] in
assembly, 1.0f might be large number e.g. 1065353216 in assembly loop,
repeated instructions may be due to loop unrolling we might see: *
superfluous loading of values off stack * more instructions required,
e.g not efficiently using SIMD (often this exposes the misconception
that compilers are better than programmers; so better to handwrite
intrinsics)</p>
<p>comparing unoptimised assembly to ‘wc’ see noticeable speed increase.
example of non-pessimisation</p>
<p>Following the basic principles of non-pessimisation, I make a note of
the huge amount of cruft in the C STL. The output buffering, hidden
<code>malloc()</code> ‘optimisations’ (uncommitted memory, encounter
expensive page faults later; prefer reliability/clarity over
edge-performance benefits), OS line ending conversions, non-obvious use
of mutexes etc. Whilst these may seem like minor inconveniences, they
can be insidious for performance, e.g. <code>rand()</code> has a huge
call-stack that if we replace with a simple xor shift, results in 3x
speed up. Although easy to criticise, it may be the situation that the
CRT had to be that way because of C standards. To isolate use of the
CRT, wrap in functions so we can hopefully replace with system calls,
intrinisics, etc. Although generally okay to use STL, it forces you to
use their patterns (e.g. memory allocation, locks etc.). This is true
for STLs in general across all languages. Some may have bloatness from
other areas, e.g. C++ templates To avoid the compiler having to generate
a large export table of all functions, make them <code>static</code> To
avoid large amounts of linking and ∴ increase compilation time, have a
unity build. Furthermore, garunteed ability to inline functions (as with
multiple translation units, possible one might only have function
declaration and not definition) (issues may occur with slower
incremental builds when including 3rd party libraries; yet, can still
work around this possibly using ccache)</p>
<h1 id="the-scripting-awakening">The Scripting Awakening</h1>
<p>I decided to try and implement ctime in Bash for pedagogical
purposes. My first task was to write and read a binary file. Googling
how to do this in Bash returned the consensus, “use another language”.
Often when I read this, I’m not deterred. I have encountered similar
naysayers before when it comes to directly using Xlib. However, when it
came to wanting structures to read and write to (essential for binary
work), I found Bash was empty. With this understanding, I realised more
generally that the usefulness of scripting languages are limited.
Specifically, they should be limited to basic tasks that involve
searching or external tool usage. I suppose my biggest use case of Bash
is for enhancing my terminal (.bashrc) and vim (<code>:.!</code>)
interactions. C is a simple language and if you understand it’s
low-level capabilities, you can do many things. However, despite this
recognition, I did come upon certain procedures to follow when working
with Bash scripts.</p>

<p>The diverse software landscape of Linux distros means that we don’t
know what version of each</p>
<p>STM32CubeMX (this justs generates code, IDE is full fledged) to
download, must get link with email. STM32CubeIDE is woefully slow.
Maximising to full screen just blurs out half Once installed, a series
of pop-up menus just keep appearing spontaneously as it has to download
more to satisfy a simple create project To download qtcreator well known
bug that it selects the wrong mirror, 3MBps to 30kbs. Have to decipher
command line arguments and mirror parsing,
e.g. ./qt-unified-linux-x64-4.3.0-1-online.run –mirror
http://ftp.jaist.ac.jp/pub/qtproject</p>
<p>My god, installing cubemx is awful. require email. password setting
for account fails.</p>
<p>QTcreator does not honour system .gdbinit file, have to manually set
breakpoints and dissassembly flavour QTCreator doesn’t show console
output. Tick ‘run in terminal’ crashes on startup</p>
<p>Before even using the program, installing is bad. Install pandoc. It
requires a pdf engine, e.g. xelatex that must be separately installed
Which name is not found with traditional
<code>sudo apt install xelatex</code>, it’s in
<code>texlive-xetex</code> and is 100MB… Searching for the appropriate
package name to install a missing dependency is what I use ubuntu stack
exchange mostly for…..</p>
<p>Firefox just forces restart</p>
<p>gpus have introduced a whole host of undocumented NDA annoyances</p>
<p>sound output varies significantly across different hardware. so, to
detect possible sound bugs we may need to invest in a good piece of
sound hardware</p>
<p>in linux, x11 is mixer for drm, pulse a mixer for alsa (more
flexibility with pulse, e.g. can disable it if only needing one
application at time, or can redirect it to another sound card) audio is
a mess in linux</p>
<p>due to disconnected nature of x11 and scheduling, must vsync.
sleeping isn’t an option due default to round-robin scheduling policy
(switching to real-time scheduling is not suitable for general-os). we
could improve by setting niceness (however must be sudo) as not real
time, we can’t control a lot of things, e.g. could be USB latency, adobe
photoshop in background, etc. on say raspberry pi could program GPIO
pins to have a accurate poll for a joystick.</p>
<p>sound on linux is absurd (tribal knowledge). even the people on the
mailing list don’t know how it works. constantly saying, don’t do this,
use a library… often times, source code is the documentation, so good
luck spending months on how to operate low level. return when threading
is involved.</p>
<p>x11 is more complicated than it needs to be. like many OS commands,
it should do a lot of the dirty work for you, as no-one knows all the
minutiae. it’s bad to think that OSs are getting harder to work with.
however, it is unfair to pick on X11, as their are other apis (even
modern) that are just as bad, even worse. x11 is particular annoying in
that if it crashes, even launching a virtual terminal may not work as
keys aren’t registered</p>
<p>if only eclispe cdt debugger was good. it terminates for no reason
when running (can sometimes be fixed by switching to run mode and then
back to debug). sometimes have to restart to fix. run-to-line doesn’t
work when inside sub-routine. memory browser crashes on entering
address. doesn’t give information on stack overflows.</p>
<p>firefox will unexpectanctly say we updated in the background and you
must restart or tab crashed etc.</p>
<p>Online help forums for QTCreator useless. In reality, only core devs
would be able to answer your question thoroughly So, this is where I see
the benefit of mailing lists</p>
<p>Often Ubuntu audio mixer just stops working and generates fuzz and
have to restart</p>
<p>Firefox facebook video chat. For some reason just mysteriously stops
working. says to restart, did that work, nope! both rev every fucking
second is probably why.</p>
<p>Unfortunate just resign yourself to choosing the software with fewest
or manageable ‘quirks’ (bugs to offensive…)</p>
<p>How on earth can something so frequently used like TeX have such
poor/cryptic parsing error information Furthermore, pandoc doesn’t treat
text as text. If different file extension, will perform different
parsing e.g. inserts ‘hidden’ YAML header if markdown file</p>
<p>FreeCAD have to click in particular order for symmetry,
e.g. point-line-point</p>
<p>QTcreator so complicated to run cross-debugger, have to write down
steps</p>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee envisioned a universal place for information
exchange. Unfortunately the freedom of creativity has resulted in much
of the Web being intrusive and hindering</p>
<p>Order of arguments matter in docker, for some reason –rm must be

<p>default firefox credential store overwrote bitwarden password.

<p>Incessent unit-testing, why not test startup assembly then. Falls
apart… What not to test, e.g. assume that hex_to_bin() simple enough to

<p>file for every test, file for every class. leads to awful build
times</p>
<p>How can software better serve humanity? e.g. bloatware causes
slowness for aus post workers</p>
<p>With UML if doing sufficiently complex to the same level as a
blueprint, may as well have just written the program the idea of
iterative design would be followed by literal architects, however too
costly and time consuming. with software, we have the ability to do
this. 1. design (urban planner): separation of code (mental clarity and
division of labour) design metrics are temporal coupling (physics
outputs data to renderer, so format is important), layout coupling
(renderer inherits from opengl), idealogical coupling (threading, width,
memory), fluidity (one change to system causes a major crash) 2.
programming (architect) 3. compiler (builder)</p>
<p>Most design patterns are just utility classes rather than a way to
architect a program</p>
<p>I don’t want to fight the language (Java). Higher level languages
should allow you to easily express cpu instructions</p>
<p>reject the idea of TDD driving good design. accept that tests
validate design. tdd and bdd have good elements in them, but the dogma
is not effective.</p>
<p>code shouldn’t take longer than 10 seconds to compile.</p>
<p>in general we don’t add security threats that weren’t already
present, e.g. loading from shared object could just as easily override
binary if have write priveleges to both</p>
<p>even though a ‘new’ language won’t crash, it can still have buffer
overruns. NullPtrExceptions</p>
<p>c++ struct functions implicitly have a this pointer. virtual
functions will result in a vtable (array of function pointers) to be
generated for that struct. therefore, virtual function will first go to
vtable, then lookup in function, so double indirection (so not a
zero-cost abstraction) normal function call just call 0x1234, however
with vtable mov rax, qword ptr [rsp + 20] etc. (dereferencing
pointers)</p>
<p>an engine makes things that aren’t likely to be difficult easy
(except for linux…) important to know low-level to write new tools. we
don’t have a wheel yet.</p>
<p>for any non-trival task, scripting languages become a hindrance with
no static type checking, no real debugger, slow, not as capable. there
are complications in software we have wrongly convinced ourselves are
necessary, e.g. scripting for hotloading hotloading C is far superior,
as C is more powerful and can use same debugger (using Lua is a
downgrade) build systems can be useful as they allow for incremental
builds (however, in negatively reinforces people to only make small
changes) (speed increase may only be noticeable for large, complex code
base) they are also useful for managing cross compilation (libraries
have to be pulled in and compile also) the idea of incorporating a
scripting language into a game was a failed experiment in 2005s. things
like a visual based interface is fine as it is constrained</p>
<p>with closed source it is often the case that a company employs
someone to oversee the experience of the software and have q+a
therefore, better quality with this higher layer of checking than open
source.</p>
<p>the best bet in safeguarding security is to reduce the attack
surface, which means to reduce the number of lines of code.</p>
<p>Don’t restrict right side of bell curve Let your aces be aces Being
an ace involves having an opinion Most influential software written
largely by one person, e.g Linux, Unix, git etc. Then a team is assigned
to maintain it. Fallacy about solo programmer productivity requiring
large teams. Design by committee pushes design to middle of bell curve
as opposing views average out</p>
<p>templates add complexity in the debugger (no actual names). only
really useful if you save a ton of code (not much code to just write
each implementation) if templates are necessary then just use
meta-programming as it is much more powerful.</p>
<p>many programs treat memory as an infinite resource. allocating memory
is introducing a failure case and making not a fan of allocation
festivals. we can create our application with minimal failure cases
(cannot do this with the platform layer).</p>
<p>uml and diagrams in general are a waste of time (its just code you
would write and often fails to capture subtleties) you should become
more proficient at reading code and understanding its relationship.</p>
<p>oh no, we had a security bug in our development version! (printf and
friends. printf %f defaults to double)</p>
<p>understanding history is important; c runtime library way of packing
return fail information is the reason for inverse truthniess</p>
<p>downloading unverified external tool, always good to get more viruses
on my machine… unless playing at EVO with some maxed out razer device,
not feasible to hit that hard I guess RTFM is the answer to that…</p>
<p>build tools are more of a hindrance! always asking yourself what
flags are being passed (linker and compiling separate steps), what files
are it picking up, what is the CWD, etc.</p>
<p>Go against merge requests from strangers and just auto let a group of
trusted people. This avoids the problem where you work for hours only to
have it blocked</p>
<p>Many online communities are anti-engineering in that they don’t
embrace criticism.</p>
<p>Do anything on web takes a lot longer than it should dealing with a
myriad of software with different odd conventions. Lack of
functionality/integration with hardware will lead to collapse Many
features lacking like type system, try to emulate. Many features have
like garbage collection try to avoid.</p>
<p>Scripting languages can cause heap fragmentation. Why just use a real
language as we want robustness (scripting languages dependent on
interpreter speed) and type checking</p>
<p>Fundamental lack of awareness that there is a better way to program.
We all make slow because of lack of time however to say it can’t be done
is a fallacy. The cultural differences with these people make it a
fool’s errand to try and get these people to program correctly e.g. time
visual studio users think is fast is less than 10 seconds?!</p>
<p>Const rarely finds bugs that I have, i.e..writing to a variable a
shouldn’t. In saying that, you should use features of language that
helps you catch bugs.</p>
<p>Apple store is hardly a free marketplace. They can just block your
app for any reason</p>
<p>DRM and engine usage make using games in the future difficult
(e.g. museum)</p>
<p>Also, the excessive testing is pushed by web where the poor languages
dictate heavy testing. Testing first makes no sense as the app may
change</p>
<p>Audiophiles think they hear things that aren’t there</p>
<p>Much like the food industry has organic vs processed, we need a term
for games that are made by people who love games and care about the
experience as opposed to large companies concerned with making money
(indie vs triple a)</p>
<p>Sometimes crashing is good because it signifies the serious problem
that can be rectified immediately rather than some other Insidious
hidden bug The problem is not mapping id/pointer (or whatever std:: c++
people would use) to an entity correctly (i.e. correspondence problem).
the symptom of this problem will be different depending on the
implementation, e.g. pointer will crash program.</p>
<p>Crazy nuttiness of command line parsing UNIX. No one remembers single
commands except privileged ls. Plus sign turning off, minus on, etc.</p>
<p>The flip side of high level languages is loss of capability in
controlling the cpu Run time languages are slower and more complex Most
scripting languages aren’t designed for modern hardware, e.g. simd,
threads</p>
<p>Scripting once, deploying everywhere is broken. You must test what
you write on each machine. Computers aren’t wonderful abstractions we
wish they were</p>
<p>C was created to solve the problem of a portable high level assembly
language for UNIX. C++ is a frankenstein languAge with bjarne just
adding features in, e.g. he just wanted c with classes. Go and rust were
designed for specific purposes, although I don’t care about safe memory

incredibly complex. People just stick to a subset of c++, which may be

an ethos of more errors when they should just be states of your

Abstractions - more code makes program as a whole more difficult to
understand. Abstractions are just hiding low level which is the most
important part and will constrain the system. Java huge call stack to
make a http request. Make lightweight abstractions only Functional
programming - Haskell around since 1990 hasn’t taken over. Imperative
more clear. Functional breaks down over non trivial work Data hiding -
poor cache performance, redundant code Excessive inheritance - poor
cache performance Exceptions - constant cognitive tax on remembering
what throws what and huge verbosity doing so. Also don’t know what
program will throw during some time Commenting - write good comments and
garden them as they can rot easily Re-use - only effective when used to

particular type of software development rapid. However they fail to
effectively utilise system resources to solve a problem that would be
easy in C. Often people are only concerned with how fast they can write
this, without caring about quality. In the web sphere google, Facebook
etc. Know their competitors aren’t going to be concerned with quality,
e.g. gmail is incredibly slow and littered with bugs (typing in a name
gives wrong result as it hasn’t finished time to server) so they use
these technologies that help to get something working quickly but will
be janky. I want to write software where quality matters and software is
enjoyable to use. Web needs to acknowledge this. They have different
thinking, e.g. network latency so we don’t have to care about
performance, no you need more effort to avoid this latency! Although
different tradeoffs made for different contexts, on a whole programming
is programming. The web is almost impossible to write good software as
have to deal with complexities that don’t have to be there. Best minds

<p>vector math routines (obtaining cross product from column vector
form) when drawing vectors in a physical sense, keep in mind they are
rooted at the origin (even if drawings show them across time) whenever
doing vector addition/subtraction, remember the head-to-tail rule (their
direction is determined by their sign). could also think that subtract
whenever you want to ‘go away’ from something dot product transpose
notation useful for emulating matrix multiplication unit circle, x =
cosθ dot product allows us to project a vector’s length onto a unit
vector dot product allows us to measure a vector on any axis system we
want by setting up two unit vectors that are orthogonal to each other
simple plane equation with d=0 will be through origin (altering d shifts
the plane up/down) cross product gives vector that is orthogonal to the
plane that the two original vectors lie on (length is |a|·|b|·sinθ). So,
really only works in at least 3 dimensions with units, e.g. for camera,
start with arbitrary ‘unit’ defintion. later move onto more physical
things like metres by applying a scaling factor to direction vector, can
move along it world space coordinates. camera position is based on
these. the camera will have its own axis system which we determine what
it should be and then use cross product based on what we want

multiplication of vectors, be explicit with a hadamard function

<p>LiPo is lithium-ion poly. uses polymer electrolyte instead of liquid.
lipo more expensive, shorter lifespan, less energy, more robust li-poly
battery is rechargeable (so rechargeable is structured to allow a
current to be passed to it to reverse the process) battery will have two
electrodes, say lithium cobalt oxide (cathode) and graphite (anode,
negative) graphite is almost always used as anode when charging, lithium
ions move to graphite when discharging, lithium ions move from graphite
to lithium so, we can see that the atomic structure of the electrodes
are changed, hence why charge cycles affect battery life LiPo is

something you should ask your grandfather about Service is like a
collection of daemons. Need for services came from growth of Web and
need for handling databases, lots of connections etc. Something like
launchd (an unit system) allows services to be started not at boot
time.<br />
Also listen for software hardware changes.<br />
So, we extend from simple bootstrapping to handling events.<br />
So, now more than service manager, a system manager As kernel more
dynamic, e.g change IRQ for device at runtime,<br />
can think of a system layer as an intermediary between kernel and users
pace.<br />
Have things like network manager. This avoids having 15 disparate
packages each with own file format config Systemd a collection of
binaries, so not exactly violating Unix philosphy Some disparity between
systemd idea and its inplementation Major component of systemd is
service manager, I.e init system to bootstrap user space</p>
<p>system level software systemd () cron (job scheduler)</p>

<p>hardlink to inode (therefore impervious to file name change,
deletion, etc.) softlink to file name</p>
<p>a directory is a mapping of filenames to inodes (for ext4

<p>journaling is regularly writing operations that are to be performed
in RAM to disk area of memory known as journal. then apply these changes
to disk when necessary this overhead makes them slower, but more robust
on crashes as can read journal to ascertain whether certain operations
finished performing</p>
<p>the metadata stored by inode determined by filesystem in use<br />
e.g. fat32 won’t store permissions, last modification time fat32 also no
journaling or soft-links inode references file metadata (pointer to

<h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2>
<p>cpu contains clock. each tick marks a step in the fetch(signal sent
along address bus as specified by PC; instruction or data sent along
data bus)- so, whenever interacting with memory, will first have to
specify address bus and get/store result via data bus therefore, for
something like LDR rax, [val] will require two fetch-executes. this is
von-neumann bottleneck most modern computers are modified-harvard, in
that the L1 caches have separate instruction and data regions.
therefore, they can be read simultaneously</p>
<p>decode-execute cycle an accumulator register is term used to indicate
typical register that holds results of large arithmetic</p>
<p>von-neumann instruction, data in RAM instructions+data share data bus
between CPU and RAM, so they have to be fetched separately</p>
<p>harvard instruction, data separate</p>
<p>in reality, all CPUs are von-neumann presented to the user and
harvard at the low-level. it’s only harvard from the pipeline/cache
stage modified harvard could also mean instruction and data bus, but
unified memory so, the variation amongst harvard architectures is in how
one transitions to the other</p>
<p>Procedure Call Standard for the Arm Architecture (AAPCS). Part of ABI
for ARM (also part of ABI is debugging, dynamic linking semantics etc.)
From this we can garner say, not to put more than 4 word sized arguments
to function as this will require stack, consuming more time and space
Furthermore, alignment restrictions mean that passing a double word has
to be even-odd register pair, so ordering of parameters important So,
call standard important for ordering and number of parameters?</p>
<p>When people say vector operations, they mean SIMD</p>
<p>endianness only relevent when reading and writing to memory addresses
and interpreting the bytes overall, endianness usefulness determined by
majority of operations performed, e.g. converting string to int easier
in big-endian e.g. little-endian easier to read values of variable
length (address does not change)</p>
<p>CISC gives reduced cache pressure for high-intensive, sustained
loops</p>
<p>memory model: visibility and consistency of changes to data stored in
memory necessary for understanding multiple thread execution</p>
<p>hardware (from machine code to execution on the CPU): * sequential
consistency (ideal as easy to understand, however doesn’t maximise
hardware speed) * x86-TSO (total store order). each processor reads from
shared memory all processors agree upon the order in which their write
queues are written to memory write queue is FIFO, so write queue is
flushed in same order as seen by the processor however, when the write
queue is flushed is up to the CPU therefore, to enforce stronger memory
ordering, architecture supplies memory barriers/fences (in a sense to
enforce sequentially consistent behaviours) to ensure write queue is
flushed before any future reads occur (without fences, I suppose write
queue length would determine whether certain synchronisation problems
occur more frequently) * ARM (most relaxed) each processor reads and
writes from its own copy of memory writes propagate to other processors
independently, i.e not all update at same time furthermore, the order of
the writes can be reordered furthermore, processors are allowed to delay
reads until writes later in the instruction stream</p>
<p>language (from source to machine code) so, C11 memory model is in
relation to rearranging of loads/stores in assembly for optimisations?
(so is a weak model?) mainly in reference to the behaviour of atomics to
synchronise programs so, language memory model will abstract away

<h2 id="legalities">Legalities</h2>
<p>anti-trust laws don’t prevent monopolies, they prevent attempting to
monopolise illegal, e.g. Microsoft attempting to monopolise browser
market</p>
<p>permissive (MIT, BSD, Apache, zlib) gives users more freedom to say
relicense, include closed source software, etc. generally just
attribution licenses (in that this is only enforcement)</p>
<p>weak copyleft (LPGL) (glibc) applies to files of library not your
entire codebase, i.e. must still release your version of the library
used so, dynamic linking makes this easier for keeping your source
closed if static, must make a few extra steps to ensure the LGPL parts
are available, e.g. publish object files</p>
<p>copyleft (GPL) enforces devlopers wants the for code on users, so the
software stays under the same license. encounter more licensing
restrictions. GPLv3 tiviosiataion, issue for Mac as their code is signed
so doesn’t allow for user modification (so deals with hardware/system
locks) code signing issues? so, GPL infects your software, enforces even
if just a library usage to release whole project as GPLv3 (so source
code released)</p>
<p>although android technically open-source, most of the software run on
it isn’t</p>
<p>creative commons is a set of licenses that make explicit requirements
for users, e.g. CC BY-NC, CC BY-SA, etc. unlike MIT, Apache includes a
user non-litigation, so users can’t initiate litigation if the creators
decide to patent something</p>
