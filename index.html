<p>Politics are infiltrating areas of technology: * Rust toolchains on
embedded. Rust developers have explicitly tweeted saying technology will
always be political * NASA Artemis Accords have first line stating
primary focus on women and person of colour on Moon Leads down the path
of FSF, and in fact any cultural revolution which thinks it can do
whatever it wants in the name of the people. Although perhaps ad
hominem, experience has shown that they’re all polite until they’re
not.</p>
<p>Seems in with big-tech, marketing is often more important than the
underlying technology. 170km ‘The Line’ ecotopia, metaverse, telsa etc.
They make wild claims and the general public has no way of knowing the
facts behind them (perception vs reality) A scary thought is that in
this age, possible for self-sustaining narratives capable of deflecting
facts</p>
<p>ARMs open-model allowed vendors to implement custom MPUs that saw in
gain dominance over oher RISCs like MIPS and AVR.</p>
<p>Tech companies becoming conglomerate monopolies, e.g. tiktok music,
apple tv etc.</p>
<p>Much like the C++ standards committee, concerns of ‘ivory tower’
nature of smart home Matter standards</p>
<p>Seeing consequences of covid semiconductor demand in chip shortages.
Exacerbated by increase usage in automotive industry and large
dependence on foundries in Taiwan</p>
<p>Annoyed at the web: * Seemingly lack of awareness of bloated and
abstracted infrastructure * New technologies in the sphere are just
sensationalised titles with little substance e.g. homescreen social
media, css layout model and js frameworks</p>
<p>The importance of programming to a physical machine is paramount. The
underlying technology is always changing, e.g. arcade machines,
consoles, phones, watches, plastic 4bit processors</p>
<p>EU lawmakers want USB-C for all mobile devices to reduce e-waste.
Makes me postulate a technocracy.</p>

<p>Time-of-flight sensors can be used to detect water levels</p>
<p>EMV (europay, mastercard and visa) secure payment technology embedded
in credit card chip</p>
<p>Waited till USB-C becoming standard to introduce reversible USB-A
(achieved with movable plastic divider and duplicated pins) Intel
thunderbolt faster than USB-C, yet ports still look very similar</p>
<p>AI in sensors used to alter configuration to optimise power
consumption AI generated voice, text. Disney can now alter age AI
parsing of voice (natural language processing) In summary, generative AI
everywhere. In fact, with ChatGPT being able to explain technical
concepts, birth of AGI (artificial general intelligence) Perhaps this
could be used as a sort of offline search engine. In fact, ChatGPT
generate prompt for DALLE Whilst ChatGPT solves problems considering
computers as generalised machines, it seems eventually it will get
there. So, embedded probably the last the be tackled due to unique
systems</p>
<p>Genetic engineering in flora seems more appetising,
e.g. drought-resistance wheat, air purifing plants</p>
<p>Batcat tool is cat with syntax highlighting</p>
<p>Skeptical of announcements made by budget-starved laboratories
(e.g. universities) about breakthroughs for technologies decades away,
e.g. fusion There are often caveats and furthermore, commerciality is
most likely decades away</p>
<p>Seems that bipartisan government action required to fix rats nest of
drivers in modern OSs in a similar vein to EU enforcing anti-competitive
laws on Apple to allow third-party apps, USB-C etc.</p>
<p>Have to be careful not to engage in technological contempt culture,
e.g. language wars. As technology changes rapidly, address changes with
temperance</p>
<p>If social media was all RSS (really simple syndication), things would
be much simpler</p>
<p>We are in a ‘gig’ economy, i.e. contract work</p>
<p>Example of Apple silicon is M1 chip. Placing some Apple silicon
inside new removable monitors to use less power from attached
computer</p>
<p>Optical computing, i.e. analog uses less power excel at linear
algebra. Makes them ideal for machine learning</p>
<p>Is prompt engineering now an important skill, as oppose to a sad
state of affairs?</p>
<p>Would controlling the weather be nice? e.g. releasing sulfur to
reflect more sunlight</p>
<p>Medical developments not just better treatments but also easier
detection, e.g. Alzheimer via blood test Even still, immune diseases
like rheumatoid arthritis are more easily treated with drugs than
osteoarthritis</p>
<p>Home appliances with WiFi connectivity allow for remote updates,
e.g. LG dishwasher</p>
<p>Seems all phones will be satellite based in the future</p>
<p>Mass production to TMSC advanced 3-nm chip underway Unfortunately
most likely due to Samsung chips having low yield, they don’t have high
QA for voltage regulation as compared to TSMC</p>
<h1 id="news---aquatic-bearings">NEWS - Aquatic Bearings</h1>
<p>Interesting ‘vivovore’ found that is an organism that eats
viruses</p>
<p>Could the US China chip ban result in China becoming more
self-reliant in the future as it’s forced to invest in own chip
production?</p>
<p>Further proliferation of OSs, e.g. Touch Ubuntu, Edubuntu, Kubuntu
etc.</p>

<p>Thread is new low-power protocol for Matter (and therefore IoT
devices, i.e. mesh network). Similar to Zigbee and Z-Wave</p>
<p>hierarchy:topology p2p:(mesh, bus) client-server:star</p>
<p>Advent of more software in cars has led to subscription based
services, e.g. heated seats. However, adding software increases
complexity: * Will lack of connectivity (e.g., no cell coverage where
you’re at) mean that the features are disabled until you get back into
cell range? * Can the servers be DOS’d so that nobody’s seat heaters
work? * If I pay for a subscription and sell a car, does the
subscription stay with the car? Or will it be like Tesla’s approach,
where the new owner has to pay to unlock the software features, even if
the previous owner paid? * What if there is a bug on the server that
incorrectly reports my subscription status? Will I be refunded, fully or
partially? * What happens when you can’t get in touch with customer
support because your subscription isn’t being properly detected on the
hardware? * What happens if the hardware breaks, but you’ve paid for the
subscription? Is repair to heated seats covered under terms of the
subscription, or will that be pushed to owners? * What happens if this
strategy is used by a smaller company than BMW, who suddenly goes out of
business and bricks your otherwise perfectly working hardware due to
shutting down servers?</p>
<p>Are big-tech companies realising the flaws in their ‘Simplicity
Sprints’ culture? Slowing hiring, realising they have way too many
employees</p>
<p>BCI (brain computer interfaces) are a real future</p>
<p>Unfortunate that ‘true security’ makes things more complex and
inconvenient, e.g. yubikey</p>
<p>Physics head-scratcher: dark matter makes up 80% of universe, yet we
can’t detect it?</p>
<p>Meta releasing AI chatbot to wild has again resulted in racist and
sexist comments</p>
<p>More evidence of contrasting quality between modern hardware and
software with worldwide Google outage caused by software update</p>
<p>Oncall software engineers akin to casual teachers</p>
<p>What are FPGAs and how do they allow the creation of hardware for
emulating old games like GBA? EU enforcing USB-C forces Apple to switch
to USB-C. Yay!</p>
<p>Oh dear, Java is not dying out (state of the octoverse)</p>
<p>Realise I’m highly misanthropic Frequent STMicroelectronics
newsletter coverage of IoT (and the many, many protocols) and machine
learning indicative of trend in industry</p>
<p>Hi-fi audio. Newer terms to mean higher fidelity/data resolution new
OLED TVs (contrast, blacks). QLED/QNED (brightness) is a adding a
‘quantom dot’ layer into the white LED backlight LCD sandwich</p>
<p>5.1 means 5 speakers, 1 subwoofer woofer, subwoofer, speaker,
tweeter</p>
<p>Things getting smaller and more data, e.g. ‘normal’ sized VR
headsets</p>
<p>I really don’t see fold phones as necessary…</p>
<p>Are we moving down the road of homogenous, e.g. specifically target
CPU or GPU or hetereogenous programming, e.g. CUDA</p>
<p>Although a update pathway is provided from 20.04 to 22.04, I’m
reluctant to do so due to possible configuration issues. Why I chose LTS
5 year support (2025)</p>
<p>Interesting maglev trains reach amazing speeds and produce minimal
noise due to lack of friction</p>
<p>Interesting blood transfusions from older mice to younger mice, the
younger mice display characteristics of old mice</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme as almost no one actually uses it in
transactions, and is purely speculative. Does not create anything.
Interesting manifestation of capitalism.</p>
<p>Moore’s law number of transistors doubles every 2 years. Although not
strictly true, general trend is holding. Proebsting’s law states that
compiler improvements will double program performance every 18 years.
Therefore, cautious about the performance benefits a compiler brings.
Focusing on programmer productivity is more fruitful In general, newer
compilers take longer to compile, but produce slightly faster code maybe
20% faster.</p>
<p>Cyberdecks are evidence that the trend of going smaller isn’t always
aesthetic</p>
<p>Growing trend to have workstations operate in the cloud or
containerisation. For testing yes, for development however?</p>
<p>Strive towards much more potent nuclear fusion (100million°C)
reactors as oppose to nuclear fission (neutron splits Uranium, same as
original nuclear bombs)</p>
<p>Amazing that certain old rpm harddrives were susceptible to crashing
when ‘Rhythm Nation’ played as the resonant frequency was the same</p>
<p>Streaming outnumbering cable and broadcast TV</p>
<p>ripgrep a much faster and user friendly grep! unar will automatically
handle pesky non-folder archives</p>
<p>Interesting to see if mir wayland will take over xlib x11</p>
<p>Although the open nature of RISC-V gives it some economical
advantages, historically the ISA has not been the major driving factor
in widespread adoption. Rather, who invests the most in R&amp;D,
e.g. many places will develop ARM, with RISC-V go on your own.</p>
<p>Security an ever present issue, e.g. every Ubuntu weekly newsletter
get a list a security updates</p>
<p>Privacy laws prevent recording keystrokes in app, however can record
other information like time between keypresses etc. to identify you,
e.g. TikTok</p>
<p>Chiplets connection of chips. So, can build chiplets that aren’t SoC,
e.g. just CPUs and SoCs without chiplets Intel R&amp;D into chiplet
technology stacking presents it as a future possibility (Apple already
uses it with two M1 max chips to M1 ultra)</p>
<p>ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Turing Award is essentially
Nobel Prize for Computer Science. Not applicable for me as awards
largely for academic contributions like papers/reports published e.g
data abstraction (Liskov substitution, Byzantine fault tolerance),
parallel computing (OpenMP standard). In some sense, the modern day
Booles and Babbages I’m more concerned with engineering feats in
software products.</p>
<p>An unfortunate reality of open tech, AI being used to make paywalls
‘smarter’</p>
<p>Read a Google research project on removing noise in photos.
Investigate source to test and am completely put off by the amount of
dependencies involved: conda (why not just whole hog and docker),
python, jax for TPU (python to tensor processing unit), external
repositories This also applied to the ‘amazing’ AI image generator
Stable Diffusion (I suppose high VRAM requirements also) Docker has uses
in CI</p>
<p>AI for everything dogma is becomming more pervasive with ‘clusters’
to train model. Although Tesla can build a supercomputer to train, like
all dogmas, not applicable to everything (readability, debugging goes
down)</p>
<p>Even air-gapped computers are not safe from sniffing</p>
<p>Seems that any in-demand tech device subject to bot scalping</p>
<p>As Moore’s law is widening, i.e. was 2 years now 4 years, companies
creating own hardware, e.g. YouTube chip to handle transcoding</p>

<p>A quadratically scaling solution is intuitive However, as we know
every match is unique, linearly scaling solution obtained with a hash
map. C++ STL implementation of hash tables are sets (just keys) and maps
Unordered variants are raw hash maps Ordered use self-balancing
red-black-tree yielding logarithmic time Simplest hashing function
<code>(x &gt;&gt; 4 + 12) &amp; (size - 1)</code> Important to keep in
mind we are executing on a physical machine and that Big-Oh is a
‘zero-cost abstraction’ world. For example, the extra overhead of
introducing a hashmap (memory allocations/copies) will result in this
being slower for small lists (also no dynamic memory allocations in ISR)
This is why C++ STL uses hybrid introsort</p>

<p>Polymorphism is a single object that can be interpreted as having
various types. This can simply be a struct with unions and a type
field.</p>
<p>Never use setters/getters unless actually doing something. You’re
spending your entire day typing. If needing, replace variable name with
name_ to see where it was used.</p>
<p>You need to be self critical to be a good engineer</p>
<p>Caches are a way of minimising roundtrip time of RAM by putting
memory as close to the core that thinks will need it L1 closest, 1/2
cycles, 32k. Wikichip for more info Cpu will go to caches first</p>
<p>L1 can supply 2 cache lines per clock Instructions per clock, number
of work components, e.g. number of add components, cache line per
cycles, cache latency, agu (address resolver units) impose restrictions
A cache miss is simply stalling for an instruction. However, this may
not be an issue if we do other work, e.g. complex algorithm takes many
instructions hiding memory access for out of order cpu. If hyper
threading with two schedulers, if cache miss on one, just switch to the
other. Can really only know if a cache miss incurs a performance penalty
by looking at raw numbers from vtune, etc. Because of the scheduler,
it’s not as simple as just looking at memory sizes So, due to complex
overlapped/scheduling nature of modern CPUs can really only know if
cache miss incurs penalty with vtune Uop website displays table for
instructions</p>
<p>Currently good that most things are little endian with 64 byte cAche
lines, however some hardware guys Is going to come along and change it
back to big endian</p>
<p>Should be code of ethics in software to not create
bugs/inconveniences for users that couldve been avoided</p>
<p>An instruction of throughput 1 means issued every clock. As many
instructions take longer than 1 cycle, each core requires a scheduler to
see if it can execute something. View cpu as sections where there is
some distance to communicate.</p>
<p>Making some thing good takes time. However, if you have crazy design
practices it will also take longer You have to be reality based when
programming. That is in an engineering sense, to design something that
solves the problem you have People become attached to a way of
programming which doesn’t focus on solving the problem. They want to
build rube-goldberg machines Selectively attacking problems seriously
means you have a functional program quicker, whereby you can actually
decide if those other problems need to be addressed. Can defer hard
decisions later as they will be made better as you will have more
technical expertise and more context to work with</p>
<p>Testing is important. If you don’t write tests, your software doesn’t
work. However, write higher level system tests, not excessive unit
tests. More efficient and this is where bugs are likely to be. You often
have to remove code, so having unit tests just increases the volume of
code you have to write. Huge drain on productivity. Maybe for NASA. A
new paradigm should weigh up cost-benefit. Almost always the cost is
ignored and people gobble them up</p>
<p>To make computers better to use, have to simplify them on all
levels</p>
<p>Faster cpu like Apple’s m1 are irrelevant if software bad</p>
<p>Floating point math faster than integers</p>
<p>my style of programming and problems enjoy solving found in embedded,
e.g your constrained with the silicon not like in web where you just
build another data centre</p>
<p>Compiler works on file by file, so knows nothing about calls across
files. Therefore it generates object files which are partially
executable machine code with unresolved symbols. Linker merges these
object files and also adds extra header information so that the OS can
load our executable (or more specifically a kernel, e.g. linux)</p>
<p>Complete code coverage on the one hand is very thorough, however
don’t get a lot of engineering output. Furthermore, most bugs appear in
between systems not in units.</p>
<p>Best way to test is to release on early access. This checks hardware
and software, user may be running adobe acrobat which hogs cpu so
instruct them to kill it before running your game. Or maybe 20000 chrome
plugins. This is something a hardware lab can’t tell you</p>
<p>Process is allocated virtual memory space OS has mapping table that
converts these to physical addresses. Part of our processes address
space is pre-populated by the kernel program loader, e.g.  linux-vdso,
environment variables, etc. Kernel tunables: sudo sh -c ‘echo
kernel.perf_event_paranoid=0 &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf’ (sysctl)
User tunables: ulimit -a In virtual address space, have user space and
kernel space address ranges. A virtual address is mostly relating to
page table indexes and the last bit is a static offset (as for security
addresses are randomized)</p>
<p>To make an installer just fwrite your executable and then data files
appended with footer. Inside the exe, fread the exe and fseek based on
the static offset of the appended resources Bake resources in for
reliability only really</p>
<p>Packed files better as less OS operations performing expensive file
handles etc.</p>
<p>Programming about solving problem. overlooked by design philosophies.
If you don’t have any functionality, you don’t have a structural
problem</p>
<p>const is only useful if you find it catches bugs for you (maybe for
globals instead of using #defines) however, in terms of optimsations,
const is useless as you can cast const away. therefore, for me, const is
mostly just a waste of typing. however, have to use for strings in C++
In a similar vein, VLAs useful here (note that sizeof(array) and
sizeof(pointer) for calculating string array count)</p>
<p>distinct areas of memory in assembly are stack, heap and data
(globals)</p>
<p>direction of stack growth is often determined by CPU. if selectable,
then OS. eg. x86 is downwards ulimit -s for stack size (main executable
will have stack size listed in headers)</p>
<p>good practice to assign variable for syntatical reasons, i.e. more
readable, e.g Controller *controller =
&amp;evdev_input_device.controller;</p>
<p>getconf can list POSIX system configurable variables</p>
<p>don’t go through a ton of unecessary stdlib. malloc probably more
optimised for small memory size requests relative to overall code base,
interfacing with system calls is not that much code (and can be
reused)</p>
<p>if we try to access memory from an invalid page (not reserved or
comitted) will get segfault. only have to worry about errors that don’t
manifest themselves on every run of the program.</p>
<p>on x86, writing by 32bit faster than 8bit as less instructions in
general, the fastest way is to use the widest possible register that can
be operated on at once the speed of accessing the memory from cache is
pretty cheap for nearby regions</p>
<p>don’t make changes for conceptual cleanliness. end of the day, want
to make performant, bug free code in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<p>when programming some days you are off. this just means you’re going
to be debugging a lot</p>
<p>we want it to be clear what our code can and cannot touch. global
variables make this hard (however, can add _ to see where they are all
used) however, as many OSs are rather janky and most code will live
outside this, it is ok to have some globals here globals are fine in
development. can repackage into a structure later.</p>
<p>clock speed not as relevent as improvements in microarchitecture and
number of cores means can be more efficient under less duress. also,
lower clock speed may be because want to draw less power.</p>
<p>short build times (under 10 seconds) are incredibly important to not
decentivness making changes and testing them</p>
<p>function overloading, generalised operator overloading and default
arguments are c++ features that can’t easily be implemented with gcc
extensions</p>
<p>note that &gt;&gt; will typically (implementation defined) perform
arithmetic shift (fill in with 1’s) on signed, so not always the same as
a divide. similarly, sign-extension just fills in the new MSBs with
1’s</p>
<p>for large cross-platform projects, best to differentiate with
filenames, rather than ifdefs. this also gives the ability to have
different control flows across the different platforms (essential)</p>
<p>for a game, better to have the game as a service to the OS (not the
other way round). this is becuase the game does not need to know/perform
the myriad of possible operations the OS can perform.</p>
<p>most modern cpus have a floating point unit, making them faster than
ints (same latency), e.g. a multiply is one instruction where ints is
two (multiply and shift) x87 is the FPU instructions for x86 (also have
SSE instructions which is want you ultimately want) however, for
multiplayer games, optimisers can give different results when using
floating point, e.g a platform that has operator fusion like a MULADD
may give different result when rounding then a platform that has do it
separate. (fixed point could solve this)</p>
<p>Programming Mentality: always important to know when coding what is
your goal. premature optimisation and design are bad. your goal
dictactes the quality of the code you write, e.g. allowed to be janky as
first pass on API. write usage code first.</p>
<p>often when having a variable lengthed array, ask ourselves do we
really need that?</p>
<p>asserts are part of debug program that are used to check that things
work that should always work. use them for a condition that must be true
that is not explicitly present</p>
<p>don’t think about memory management, but rather memory usage. if
having to worry about freeing etc. done something wrong.</p>
<p>when writing ‘spec’ code, no need to handle all cases; simply note
down the edge cases you should handle later on stop yourself thinking
about whether the code is messy or not. only care once problem is
solved!</p>
<p>it’s not the programming practice but the dogma that gets you. when
you start to name things it almost always becomes bad. almost all
programming practices have a place, just not used often so RAII people,
in case of things that must be released, e.g DeviceContext, ok to use a
constructor/destructor pair. I’ll throw you a bone there</p>
<p>streaming i/o is almost never a good choice (hard drive slowest, more
errors)</p>
<p>compression orientated programming is you code what you need at the
time (breaking out into function, combining into struct, etc.) over time
the code marches towards a better overall quality</p>
<p>amdahls law gives the time taken for execution given a number of
cogives the time taken for execution given a number of cores. for this
formula (indeed any formula) we can obtain some property by seeing as
function parameter approaches infinity. in this case, the parallelising
part drops out. brooks law says that simply adding more people to a
problem does not necessarily make it faster. if requires great deal of
coordination/communication actually slows down.</p>
<p>solving a problem: 1. decide what you are doing (this can’t be
open-ended.) 2. organise groups to achieve this by making these
boundaries, we are presupposing that each part is separate, e.g tyres
team and engine team; assume tyres and engine cannot be one piece.
therefore, the boundaries define what products you can make, i.e. you
produce products that are copies of yourself or how you are structured
so, in software if we assign teams for say audio, 2d, 3d we would expect
individual APIs for each. the org chart is the asymptote, so it’s the
best case that we make a product as granular as our org chart. it could
be far worse and even more granular therefore, communication between
teams is more costly than communication within teams. takeaway is that
low-cost things can be optimised, high-cost can’t be (further away on
the org chart) note that communication in code could just be someone
checking something in and you pulling it what we are seeing now with
modern software is the superposition of orgcharts due to use of legacy
codebases now we see org charts in software, where people are
artifically creating inheritence hierarcies that limit how the program
works this is very bad. the reason it’s done is for people to create
mental models that help them solve the problem as they can’t keep the
complexity in their head. it may be necesary to solve the problem,
however it shouldn’t be looked at as good. however, because it’s done
due to lack of understanding, the delegation/separation is not done with
enough information. so you limit possibilities of the design space. so
although, libraries, microservices, encapsulation, package managers,
engines may be necessary due to our brain capacity (until neuralink or
we figure out a better way to do them) they are not good! we may use
hash map, but only in a particular way They limit optimisation as we
have already decided separation so always be on the lookout for times
when you don’t have to do these most people just download hundreds of
libraries because they know it works and they won’t be worse than any
one else. WE MUST BE LEAN AND FLEXIBLE IN ORGCHARTS IN COMPANY AND IN
SOFTWARE TO INCREASE DESIGN. some old codebases need to be retired</p>
<p>DO THE ‘MOST CERTAIN’ THING FIRST. THIS COULD EITHER BE THE
IMPLEMENTATION OR THE USAGE CODE choose data structures around solving
problem</p>
<p>some software is scaffolding, i.e. not shipped with the final
product, e.g. editor for games</p>
<p>To make anything alternate over time, just multiply by
sine(time);</p>
<p>Data hiding hides what the CPU is doing, which is what we care
about</p>
<p>Require machine-specific documentation files to understand system we
are on System specific ctags template projects, e.g. linux kernel,
glibc, etc. If using library, have ctags for that project</p>
<p>ALMOST ALWAYS CAST TO FLOAT WHEN DOING DIVISIONS LEADING TO FLOAT</p>
<p>Minimum value starts at max</p>
<p>Spreading out randomness:
<code>final_value += contrib * sample</code></p>
<p>If debug code (or code that will not be in release) use compile-time
macros</p>
<p>Use GLOBAL and global_prefix If casting is occuring, always be
explicit about it! Prefixing functions with sdl2_func() or linux_func()
only if intending to be cross-platform</p>
<p>With error handling, bad practice is to allow a lot of errors, which
brings in error classes etc. Instead, if it’s something that is actually
an error, e.g. missing file, write the code to explicitly handle it.
Handling the error in a sense makes it no longer an error, rather a
feature of the program</p>
<p>if function is expecting a range between, should we clamp to it?</p>
<p>Refactoring Mentality: Refactoring is essential. You must know what
you are trying to achieve so you have some notion of progress,
e.g. adding a constraint to the system. (Replacing variable type in
scope gives us all locations where variable was used, including macros.
This us where dynamic lnguages fail as you don’t know if you broke
something)</p>
<p>You can abstract/encapsulate anything at anytime, so why not do it
later when you know what you are doing? We want file format to be simple
and binary, unlike json which is general purpose and string</p>
<p>modifying (parse as pointer arg), returning (result struct). it is
best to put simple types are arguments rather than a group struct to
allow for maximum code reuse. only put group struct as arguments if must
be put together (in general don’t pack so don’t force user to create a
struct when they may already have the values)</p>
<p>if can go functional without sacrificing, saves you complexity down
the road. oftentimes simply utilising elements of functional programming
is good, e.g. no global state, only operating on parameters etc.</p>
<p>writing code guides you to the right design, e.g. made same call
-&gt; put into function; require args in function -&gt; struct; many
related functions together -&gt; organise related functions into own
file; (if thinking could be moved to another file, make comment sections
outlining code blocks to ease this process later on) etc. (these are
simple, compression changes), complex api -&gt; transient struct,
overload functions for internal/external use There are also large
changes that are more difficult, e.g.  sections of single value
interpreted differently -&gt; pack 2 variables into 1 (_ technique
useful here) same operations performed on pairs of variables -&gt;
vectors (as oppose to working with them as scalars) vectors are
particularly useful as without them repeated actions quickly become
intractable It can get messy at times, but always know that a clean
solution is out there and you will refine towards it Work threw the
error tree one at a time Important to throw in asserts for underlying
assumptions. Also for debugging be aware of ‘copy-pasta’, e.g. copying
variables will have same name for two parameters as didn’t replace
it</p>
<p>we don’t want to orient our code around objects (if anything,
algorithmic oriented). its about how you arrive at some code that
determines how good it is</p>
<p>excessive pre-planning and setting waypoints is really only useful if
you’ve done the problem before (which in that case you’re not really
designing) instead, we become a good pathfinder, learning to recognise
the gradient of each day of the journey. when write the simplest thing
and loft it out into good design later (in this explorative phase, if we
make an changes for efficiency reasons we have just introduced the
possibilities of bugs with no benefit)</p>
<p>only break into function when you know what you want, e.g. called
multiple times or code finalised and improved readability (in which case
a tradeoff is made between understanding functionality and
semantics)</p>
<p>Don’t be scared of mass name changing!! Before doing so, see all
places where name is used Don’t be scared of long list of compiler
errors. Work your way through them</p>
<p>Refactoring with usage code: just write out structures that satisfy
the usage code. If major rewrite use #if 0 #endif to allow for
successful compiling</p>
<p>refactoring just copy code into function that gets it to compile.
later, worry about passing information in as a parameter basic debug and
release compiler flags When refactoring, utilise our vimrc <C-F> all
files Also, just pull code out into desired function and let the
compiler errors guide you Returning multiple values, just return struct
To reduce large number of function parameters, put into struct</p>
<p>Debugging Mentality: debugging stepping through pass-by-pass.
inspecting all variables and parameters and verifying state of
particular ones. make deductions about state of variables, e.g
overflowed, uninitialised, etc. drop in asserts draw it out</p>
<p>being able to draw out debug information is very useful. time spent
visualising is never wasted (in debugger expressions also)</p>
<p>When debugging, look through variables and see if anything looks
ridiculous</p>
<p>When in debugger, go iteratively progress through variable values in
function and see if they look right We can isolate some area of the code
and say this is probably the problem Then investigate relevent
sub-functions, etc. This can be a long process with seemingly little
gains. The issue could be subtle, e.g. signed/unsignedness size,
function called rarely</p>
<p>Configuration files should be copied, not generated (becomes too
messy) Symlink to template files from projects</p>
<p>To begin, I ensured that I had a debugger from which I could easily
step through the application’s execution. In code, I was able to
programmatically set system and user breakpoints.</p>
<p>(mocking of syscalls for unit testing with file i/o)</p>
<p>For handling non-fatal errors, single line check. For fatal errors,
nest all preceding code (I have learnt to not be afraid of indentation
in this manner). (error handling in general, i.e. reduce ‘errors’ by
making them part of normal execution flow)</p>
<p>When performing the common task of grouping data, a few practices to
keep in mind. Use fixed sized types to always know about struct padding
(in fact, I like to extend this to all my code)</p>
<p>If wanting multiple ways of accessing grouped data, use union and
anonymous structs. Use an int to reference other structs,
e.g. <code>plane_index</code></p>
<p>If the data being grouped can only exist together (e.g. points), use
vectors. Put all structs related typedefs inside their own header file
for easy access.</p>
<p>As floats are an approximation, when comparing to 0.0f (say for a
denominator check) or negative (say for a square root) use a
tolerance/epsilon less-than/greater-than check. In fact whenever
dividing should always ask oneself “can the value be zero?” To be clear
about float to int casting, use a macro like truncate/round (think about
what if uneven divide) Due to mixed integer and float arithmetic going
to float, calculate integer percentages <code>val * 100 / total</code>
There is no need to overload the division operator as can do
<code>(* 1.0f / val)</code></p>
<p>For easy substitution, use single letter prefix names like
<code>output_h</code> and <code>output_w</code>. Convention for variable
arrays, e.g. <code>Planes plane[1]</code>, <code>planes</code> and
<code>plane_count (use ARRAY_COUNT macro here)</code> Put for loop
statements on separate line to help not be afraid of indentation.
Iterate over pixel space and then convert to say, world space for
calculations (normalisation and lerp) Aspect ratio correction is simply
rearranging a ratio. If we determine one side is larger, scale other.
Use “ ASCII code to print a status indicator. Only use const for char *
string literals stored in the data segment.</p>
<p>Endianness comes into play when reading/writing from disk (e.g. file
type magic value) and working directly with <code>u8 *</code>
(e.g. iterating through bytes of a u32)</p>

<p>CPU contains a clock. Each tick marks a step in the
fetch-decode-execute cycle. The signal will be sent along the address
bus as specified by program counter and instruction or data will be
returned along the data bus.</p>
<p>Von-Neumann has instructions and data share address space. The
Von-Neumann bottleneck occurs when having multiple fetches in a single
instruction, e.g. ldr Harvard has instructions and data with separate
address spaces In reality, all CPUs present themselves as Von-Neumann to
the user, however for efficiency they are modified Harvard at the
hardware level, i.e. pipeline/cache stage. Specifically, will have
separate L1 cache for instructions and data. (also have uOP cache
considered L0) Therefore, when an architecture is described as Harvard,
almost certainly modified Harvard.</p>
<p>Endianness only relevent when interpreting bytes from a cast Can
really only see usefulness of Big Endian for say converting string to
int Little Endian makes recasting variables of different lengths easier
as starting address does not change</p>
<p>Although the instruction set supports 64bits, many CPUs address buses
don’t support entire 16 exabytes. As we have no need for 16 exabytes
(tera, peta, exa), the physical address size may be 39bits, and virtual
size 48bits to save on unused transistors.</p>
<p>Direct-mapped cache has each memory address mapping to a single cache
line Lookup is instantenous, however high number of cache misses.
Fully-associative cache has each memory address mapping to any cache
line. The entire cache has to be searched, however low number of cache
misses. Set-associative cache divides cache into fully-associative
blocks. An 8-way cache means the number of cache lines in a block. This
is best in maintaining a fast lookup speed and low number of cache
misses.</p>
<p>Cache sizes will stay relatively small due to the nature of how
computers are used. At any point, there is only a small amount of local
data the CPU will process next. So, beyond the empirical sweet spot of
approximately 64MB, having a larger cache will yield only marginal
benefits for cost of SRAM and die-area, i.e. law of diminishing
returns.</p>
<p>Check if in L1. If not go check in L2 and mark least recently
accessed L1 for move to L2. Bubbles up to L3 until need for memory
access which will go to memory controller etc.</p>
<p>Alignment ensures that values don’t straddle cache line
boundaries.</p>
<p>CISC gives reduced cache pressure for high-intensive, sustained loops
as less instructions required. Instructions will have higher cycle
count. Also typically a register-memory architecture, e.g. can add one
value in a register and one in memory together (as oppose to
load-store)</p>
<p>TDP (thermal design power) maximum amount of heat (measure in watts)
at maximum load that is designed to be dissipated (bus sizes of chips
smaller, so TDP getting lower) However, value is rather vague as could
be measured on over-clock and doesn’t take into account ambient
conditions</p>
<p>Clock frequency will often be changed by OS scheduler in idle moments
or thermal throttling</p>
<p>Hardware scheduler allows for hyperthreading which is the sharing of
execution units. Therefore, hyperthreading not a boon in all situations.
AMD refers to this as simultaneous multithreading.</p>
<p>Microarchitecture will affect instruction latency and throughput
byway of differening execution and control units. For Intel CPUs, i3-i7
of same generation will have same microarchitecture. Just different
cache, hyperthreading, cores, die size etc.</p>
<p>Codec is typically a separate hardware unit that you interact with
via a specific API HEVC (H.265; high efficiency video coding) newer
version of H.264 VP9 is a open source Google video coding format</p>
<p>When people say vector operations, they mean SIMD. SSE registers are
128bits (4 bytes) XMM, AVX are 256bits (8 bytes) YMM</p>
<p>Average CPU die-size is 100mm². GPU much larger at 500mm² as derives
more benefits from more control units, i.e. parallelisation Common

(Total Store Order): All processors agree upon the order in which their
write queues are written to memory However, when the write queue is
flushed is up to the CPU * ARM (most relaxed/weak) Writes propagate to
other processors independently, i.e not all update at same time
Furthermore, the order of the writes can be reordered Processors are
allowed to delay reads until writes later in the instruction stream</p>
<p>A software memory model, e.g a language memory model like C++ will
abstract over the specific hardware memory model it’s implemented on. It
will provide synchronisation semantics, e.g. atomics, acquire, release,
fence etc. These semantics are used to enforce sequentially consistent
behaviour when we want it. However, using intrinsics, we can focus only
on hardware memory model.</p>
<p>TODO: is cache coherency a subset of memory model? Intel uses
write-back i.e. MESI? so not MOSI? x86 CPUs use a variation on the MESI
protocol (MESIF for Intel, MOESI for AMD) to keep their caches coherent
with each other Cache coherency is how caches agree upon writes in
cache?</p>
<h2 id="legalities">Legalities</h2>
<p>Anti-trust laws don’t prevent monopolies, they prevent attempts to
monopolise by unfair means, e.g. Microsoft browser market, Apple app
store etc.</p>
<p>Technically, any digital work created is automatically protected by
copyright. So, without a license, people would have to explicitly ask
for permission to use</p>
<p>Permissive (MIT, BSD, Apache, zlib) gives users more freedom to say
relicense, include closed source software, etc. They generally just
enforce attribution Apache like MIT except must state what files you
have changed</p>
<p>Weak copyleft (LPGL) applies to files of library not your entire
codebase, i.e. must still release your version of the library used So,
dynamic linking makes this easier for keeping your source closed If
statically linking, must make a few extra steps to ensure the LGPL parts
are available, e.g. publish object files</p>
<p>Copyleft (GPL) enforces the developers usage of the code. So, any
derivative software must release whole project as GPL, i.e infects your
software (and restricts choice of libraries to GPL) Subsequently
encounter more licensing restrictions.</p>
<p>Creative commons licenses are composed of various attributes. The
default is attribution. They are typically used in artworks,
e.g. images, audio files Other elements are optional and can be combined
together, e.g no derivative, no financial, must share under same
license.</p>
<p>Public domain means no license, so could claim as yours</p>
<h2 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h2>
<p>UUID/GUID (universally/globally) 16 bytes. Typically generated by
concatenating bits of MAC address and timestamp</p>
<p>UEFI firmware interface made to standardise interface between OS and
firmware for purposes of booting</p>
<p>Called /dev/sd as originally for SCSI (small computer system
interface; standards for transferring data between computers and
devices) The preceding letter indicates the order in which it’s found,
e.g. /dev/sda first found The preceding number indicates the partition
number, e.g. and /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2</p>
<p>UEFI use of GPT (GUID partition table) incorporates CRC to create
more recoverable boot environment over BIOS MBR (located in first sector
of disk) Furthermore, UEFI has more addressable memory in 64-bit mode as
oppose to only 16-bit mode Also, UEFI supports networking The ESP (EFI
system partition) will have EGI entries that point to a UUID of where to
boot one of these will be grub binary like shimx64.efi NOTE: The
bootloader is the EFI OS loader and is part of the OS that will load the
kernel</p>
<p>ACPI interface to pass information from firmware to OS. This firmware
will have hardware information baked into it set by manufacturers</p>
<h2 id="formats">Formats</h2>
<p>Inodes store file metadata. The metadata stored by an inode is
determined by filesystem in use, except for filename which is never
stored Typical metadata includes size, permissions, data pointer NOTE:
FAT32 won’t store permissions, last modification time, no journaling or
soft-links</p>
<p>A filename maps to an inode. Therefore a directory is a mapping of
filenames to inodes</p>
<p>A hardlink references an inode, and is therefore impervious to file
name change, deletion, etc. A softlink is to a file name</p>
<p>Journaling is the process of regularly writing operations that are to
be performed in RAM to disk area of memory known as journal. then apply
these changes to disk when necessary this overhead makes them slower,
but more robust on crashes as can read journal to ascertain whether
certain operations finished performing</p>
<p>FAT for ESP (because FAT simple, open source, low-overhead and
supported virtually everywhere) vFAT is driver (typically for FAT32)</p>
<p>EXT4 for system (supports larger file sizes) (NTFS microsoft
proprietary) Most filesystems will use a self-balancing tree to index
files</p>
<h2 id="unix">Unix</h2>
<p>Ubuntu distro as compared to debian more user friendly. For example,
automatically includes proprietary drivers like WiFi, has PPAs to allow
installation of 3rd party applications, and install procedure just
works. Also updates more regularly than Debian and provides LTS, so know
regular backports provided</p>
<p>Linux is a monolithic kernel, i.e. drivers, file system etc. are all
in kernel space. So, more efficient, not as robust to component failure
Windows uses a hybrid kernel, moving away from original microkernel due
to inefficiencies Using Ubuntu generic kernel (could also have
-lowlatency etc.) to not include a lot of modules in kernel to free up
RAM usage</p>
<p>Xfce as default Ubuntu GNOME had bug with multiple keyboards.
Furthermore, Xfce codebase was readable when inspecting X11 code. In
addition, Xfce automatically provided GUI shortcut creation</p>
<p>.deb and .rpm are binary packages. Annoyances arise due to specifying
the specific library dependency for each distro version Flatpaks and
Snaps are containerised applications that include the specific libraries
and runtimes AppImages combine the ‘shared’ libraries and runtimes of
Flatpaks and Snaps into a giant file. This file can be copied and run on
any distro If packages is being actively maintained, preferable to use
.deb as faster and simpler</p>
<p>Linux DRM (direct rendering manager) -&gt; X11 (display server) -&gt;
xfce (desktop environment)<br />
Linux ALSA (advanced linux sound architecture) -&gt; pulseaudio (sound
server)</p>
<p>SystemV ABI: rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9 (6 integer arguments) xmm0,
xmm1, xmm2, xmm3, xmm4, xmm5, xmm6 (7 floating arguments) Remaining
arguments pushed right-to-left on stack rax return and syscall number
Stack 16-byte aligned before function call SSE2 is baseline for x86-64,
so make efficient for __m128</p>
<p>A premptive scheduler will swap processes based on specific criteria.
Round-robin means each process will run for a designated time slice CFS
is a premptive round-robin scheduler. Time slices are dynamic, computed
like <code>((1/N) * (niceness))</code> Processes are managed using a
RB-Tree. Therefore, cost of launching a process or a context switch is
logarithmic Kernel will have an internal tick rate that updates waiting
threads. Lowering this will increase granularity however will increase
CPU time and hence battery time as more time spent in kernel code.
Windows scheduler uses static priorities, so one intensive process can
dominate CPU</p>
<p>System level refers to inbetween kernel and userspace, e.g. network
manager Systemd is a collection of system binaries, e.g. udev Primarily,
systemd is a service manager A service extends the functionality of
daemons, e.g. only start after another service, restart on failure after
10s etc. The kernel will launch systemd init service that will then
bootstrap into userspace (hence alllowing for the aforementioned service
features)</p>
<p>Kernel offers various methods of process isolation, e.g. chroot,
cgroups etc. (chroot cannot access files outside its designated tree) A
container will utilise one of these options provided by the kernel to
acheive: * cannot send signals to processes outside container * has own
networking namespace * resource usage limits</p>
<p>ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) Header contains type,
e.g. executable, dynamic, relocatable and entrypoint A section is
compile time: * .text (code) * .bss (uninitialised globals) * .data
(globals) * .rodata (constants) A segment is a memory location, e.g
.dseg (data), .eseg (eeprom) and .cseg (code/program)</p>
<p>Typically stored as crt0.s, this will perform OS specific run-time
initialisation. The conditions assumed here will be outlined in ABI,
e.g. argc in rdi Some functions include setting up processor registers
(e.g. SSE), MMU, caches, threading ABI stack alignment, frame pointer
initialisation, C runtime setup (setting .bss to 0), C library setup
(e.g. stdout, math precision) The program loader will load from Flash
into RAM then call _start (which is crt entrypoint)</p>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>Storage device sizes are advertised with S.I units, whilst OS works
with binary so will show smaller than advertised (1000 * 10³ &lt; 1024 *
2¹⁰) Also, storage device write speeds are sustained speeds. So, for
small file sizes expect a lot less</p>
<p>A flip-flop is a circuit that can have two states and can store
state. Various types of flip-flops, e.g. clock triggered, data only etc.
A latch is a certain type of flip-flop. Called this as output is latched
onto state until another change in input.</p>
<p>Registers and SRAM stored as flip-flops. DRAM is a single transistor
and capacitor</p>
<p>SRAM (static) is fast, requires 6 transistors for each bit. So,
3.2billion transistors for 64MB cache. Sizeable percentage of die-area
SRAM more expensive, faster as not periodically refreshed.</p>
<p>DRAM (dynamic) is 1 transistor per bit refreshed periodically. SDRAM
(synchronises internal clock and bus clock speed). SDRAM. LPDDR4
(low-power; double pumping on rising and falling edge of clock,
increasing bus clock speed while internal typically stays the same,
amount prefetched etc.)</p>
<p>DIIM (Dual In-Line Memory Module) is form factor with a wider bus
SODIMM (Small Outline)</p>
<p>CAS (Column Address Strobe), or CL (CAS latency) is time between RAM
controller read and when data is available. RAM frequency gives maximum
throughput, however CL affects this also. In addition, RAM access is
after cache miss, so direct RAM latency is only a percentage of total
latency as time taken to traverse cache and copy to it.</p>
<p>NAND and NOR flash are two types of non-volatile memory NOR has
faster read, however more expensive per bit and slower write/erase NOR
used in BIOS chips (firmware will be motherboard manufacturer,
e.g. Lenovo) A NAND mass storage device will require a controller chip,
i.e. a microcontroller How the controller accesses the NAND flash,
i.e. the protocol under which its Flash Translation Layer operates, will
determine what type of storage it is: * SD (secure digital) * eMMC
(embedded multimedia card): Typically SD soldered on motherboard * USB
(universal serial bus) * SSD (solid state drive): Parallel NAND access,
more intelligent wear leveling and block sparring 3D VNAND (Vertical)
memory increases memory density by vertically stacking NAND flash</p>
<p>Form factors include M.2 keying and PCIe (Peripheral Component
Interconnect) Interface includes SATAIII, NVMe (non-volatile memory host
controller) and PCIe SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) SSD is
the lowest grade SSD. A single form factor may support multiple
interfaces, so ensure motherboard has appropriate chipset</p>
<p>Each CPU socket has memory banks that are local to it, i.e. can be
accessed from it directly. NUMA (non-uniform memory access) means that
accessing memory from a non-local bank will not be the same speed. A
NUMA-aware OS will try to mitigate these accesses.</p>
<p>RAID (redundant array of independent disks) is method of combining
multiple disks together so as to appear like one disk called an array.
Various types, e.g. RAID0 (striping) some parts of file in multiple
disks, RAID1 (mirroring) each disk is duplicate so could give speed
increase etc.</p>
<p>Battery will have two electrodes, say lithium cobalt oxide and
graphite. When going through a charging/discharging cycle, ions move
between electrodes. So, charging cycles will affect the atomic structure
of the electrodes and hence affect battery life.</p>
<p>Circuits based on conventional current, i.e. + to - Cathode is
terminal from which conventional current flows out of, i.e. negative</p>
<p>LiPo (lithium-ion polymer) uses polymer electrolyte instead of
liquid. Standard lithium-ion has higher energy density, cheaper, not
available in small sizes and more dangerous due to liquid electrolyte
LiPo more expensive, shorter lifespan, less energy, more robust LiPo
battery is structured to allow a current to be passed to it to reverse
the process of oxidation (loss of electrons), i.e. is rechargeable</p>
<p>Battery 51Watt/hr, which is A/hr * V is not a fixed value, e.g. 1A/hr
could run 0.1A for 10 hours</p>
<p>Petrol cars still use lead-acid as they have lower internal
resistance and so can give higher peak current then equivalent LiPo
(just not for as long)</p>
<p>HDMI(High Definition Multimedia Interface)-A, C (mini), D (micro)

<p>Ethernet CAT backwards compatible. Connector called RJ45 Telephone
cable called RJ11</p>
<p>IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) power cords used for
connecting power supplies up to 250V, e.g. kettleplug, cloverleaf</p>
<p>DC barrel jack</p>
<p>Touch screen types need some external input to complete circuit
Resistive works by pressure pushing down plastic&lt;-electric
coating-&gt;glass Unresponsive, durable, cheap Capacitive contains a
grid of nodes that store some charge. When our finger touches charge
flows through us and back to the phone, changing the electric current
read. We are good conductor due to impure water ion in us. So, things
electrically similar to our fingers will work also like sausages, banana
peels</p>
<p>1080i/p 1080 references vertical height in pixels Interlaced means
display even and odd rows for each frame. Due to modern high bandwith
not used anymore. Progressive will display each row sequentially for a
given frame</p>
<p>4k means horizontal resolution of approximately 4000 pixels. standard
different for say television and projection industry, e.g. 3840
pixels</p>
<p>A voltage applied to ionised gas, turning them into superheated
matter that is plasma. Subsequent UV is released.</p>
<p>LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) involves backlight through crystals. IPS
(In-Plane Switching) and TFT (Thin Film Transistor) are example crystal
technologies. For an LED monitor, the LED is the backlight, as oppose to
a fluorescent. However still uses LCD backlight, so really LED LCD.
QLED/QNED (Quantum NanoCell) is a adding a ‘quantom dot’ layer into the
white LED backlight LCD sandwich. OLED is distinct. It produces own
light, i.e. current passed through an OLED diode to produce light. LTPO
(Low Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide) is a backplane for OLED
technology.</p>
<p>E-ink display uses less power than LCD as only uses power when
arrangment of colours changes.</p>
<p>HDR (High Dynamic Range) and XDR (Extreme Dynamic Range) increase
ability to show contrasting colours.</p>
<p>Nit is a measure of luminance, i.e. intensity of light Brightness is
a subjective perception of luminance. A higher nit display is more
easily viewable in a wider array of lighting conditions, e.g. will
combat the sun’s light reflecting off the surface in an outdoor
setting</p>

<p>TODO: testing procedures</p>
<p>REST (representational state transfer) is an interface that outlines
how the state of a resource is interacted with On the web, an URL is an
access point to a resource A RESTful API will have URLs respond to CRUD
requests in a standard way: * GET example.com/users will return list of
resource, i.e. all users * POST example.com/users will create a new
resource * GET example.com/users/1 return single resource * PUT
example.com/users/1 update single resource * DELETE example.com/users/1
