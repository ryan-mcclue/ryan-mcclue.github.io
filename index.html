<h2 id="e-commerce">E-COMMERCE</h2>
<p>Branding/idea and website are essential</p>
<p>find products from amazon, etsy, ebay, etc. however, only sell with
aliexpress as offers dropshipping methods, i.e. no packaging alibaba is
wholesale not dropshipping, i.e. must buy in bulk</p>
<p>paid ads on facebook, instagram, tiktok</p>
<p>for supplier, can get faster than aliexpress however cost more</p>
<p>add x3-x5 markup on product to pay for ever increasing advertising
cost</p>
<p>(buying in bulk will get faster shipping times) manually -&gt; DSers
app to automate purchases -&gt; sourcing agent be upfront with customers
regarding shipping time at the start (we are just testing,
i.e. consistent sales and proof of demand at the start, so long shipping
times are fine. just mention in FAQ or shipping policy etc.) (get
customisable product later, i.e. branded box as will have to pay in bulk
on Alibaba for them to do this)</p>
<p>Handling Returns: 1. damaged: get user to send photo, have them keep
the product, get supplier to ship another 2. ok: ask user to pay for
shipping costs back to you. then refund them</p>
<p>TikTok film yourself using a product, see if video can go viral
(whole skill in itself)</p>
<p>ads spend $50 per day. around $150-$200 to test a product until find
a winner</p>
<p>front-loaded time investment. once found good product, 30-60min per
day of ads (ads manager, metrics, etc.) 2-3 hours a day overall spend
daily time on product research (DEVELOP SKILLS TO FIND A PRODUCT THAT IS
WANTED AS A GOOD PRODUCT IS KEY), copyrighting, competitors, etc.</p>
<p>niche store</p>
<p>targeting impulse buyers, not value shoppers (so, sell under $100)
show innovative product with wow factor, they buy on the spot</p>
<p>if product out of stock, refund and send them a 10% discount code</p>
<h3 id="branding">BRANDING:</h3>
<p>digital age allows for microexperiments to test market, instead of
wasting capital on something that could fail (i.e. put advertising into
market first to see how customers react)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Test market We are only concerned with determing purchase intent.
Customer experience will initially be poor due to long shipping times.
Aliexpress -&gt; CJDropshipping, Spocket, Zendrop, uDroppy,
WiiO</p></li>
<li><p>Sourcing agent (when have 10-20 orders a day) Can reduce pricing,
faster shipping, custom packaging, thank you notes, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Local fulfillment bulk buying and shipping to a 3PL (3rd party
logisitics)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>does it target niche customer (write down target audience and their
problems you are solving) get product that solves problem or adds value
to their life in a meaningful way product must have a unique selling
point high perceived value or problem solver, e.g. posture corrector
-&gt; solves problem vegetable slicer -&gt; adds value can’t be bought
in stores (not commonly advertised, not a basic product in store) (no
one will buy it from an unknown store if not unique) targeted to
customer niche lightweight and easy to ship possible to add markup pick
something that you have expertise in, allowing for easier market
research - health (back pain, sun-burn); pet supplies needs to have
WOW/UNIQUE-factor to GRAB ATTENTION IN AD</p>
<p>Have 5-10 products on website to build trust. Only put ads in for one
HERO PRODUCT at a time</p>
<p>DAILY RESEARCH TO SELECT PRODUCTS: TIME CONSUMING PROCESS TO
UNDERSTAND MARKET REGULAR ACTIVITY, NO OFF SWITCH - manual (see what
products are selling well on websites); Google Trends to verify search
volume for product - social media ads (follow big theme instagram pages,
initiate checkout to get ad algorithm to follow) - (START WITH THIS: spy
tools (combine previous 2)) - IMPORTANT: The only way to know if will
work is to test with your own ads. These are just indicators - identify
how much competitor selling for by reverse searching image As gain
experience, will see products over and over again, i.e. product
saturation (Google Trends can show this)</p>
<h3 id="store-creation">STORE CREATION</h3>
<p>Make website fit your brand before adding ads</p>
<p>Make sure domain is available before setting site name (short word
namelix.com) Also ensure domain is verified and web events prioritised
before ads?</p>
<p>Tracking essential before running ads, so as to better optimise ads
Facebook/tiktok pixels tracking code on website installable through
shopify app Google analytics as well</p>
<p>(Zoho) info@storename.com</p>
<p>Shopify payments (credit cards) and paypal (business account)</p>
<p>Shopify apps: * Fulfillment app: DSers -&gt; aliexpress
(CJDropshipping, S-pocket, weho, zendrop all have there own apps) *
Aftership (helps customers track order) * Klaviyo/SMSBump marketing
channels (email/text, e.g. abandoned cart emails etc.) * Vitals (Product
Reviews, Volume Discounts/Product Bundles (Upsells), Currency Converter,
Visitor Replays, Wheel of Fortune, Frequently Bought Together, Related
Products and Product Description tabs.) (want to save purchase
information to allow one-click purchasing if returning to increase LTV)
(offer discount in post-purchase emails) (GO INTO SHOPIFY AND MODIFY
CONFIRMATION EMAIL TO INCLUDE 24HR DISCOUNT CONFIRMATION EMAILS HAVE
100% OPEN-RATE)</p>
<p>Put shipping times at bottom of product page, shipping policies and
FAQs</p>
<p>Essential pages: Home Page, About Us, Product Pages, FAQs, Legal
Policies and Contact Us add a Shipping Policy and Track Your Order page
via the Aftership app</p>
<p>Conversion rate optimisation (if not getting sales, one of these
needs improving): * Product Photos (5-10 photos; flat-lays on
whitebackground and lifestyle someone using) initially source from
Aliexpress, alibaba, amazon (later down the track can: take photos
yourself, 3D realistic model from fiverr/upwork, get professional photos
etc.) * Pricing (Compare at Price on Shopify for discount offering?)
(Test free shipping. Perhaps best to offer free shipping over $X to
increase AOV) * Product Description Hero lines describing one core
benefit (i.e. how improve’s life) then 5 bullet-points describing more
features (i.e. what the product does) MAKE SURE BENEFIT IS
TANGIBLE/SPECIFIC AND METRIC BASED IF POSSIBLE, E.G 1000 songs in pocket
can look at real reviews and write description on their pain points *
Product Reviews (import reviews from Aliexpress via Vitals app and
ensure grammar is correct and have both good and bad reviews) (hero
product should have the most) * Website Speed (jpgs over pngs (crushpics
app), no videos, low number of apps)</p>
<p>Make sure have a 30day money-back garuntee. Ensure customers can
contact easily</p>
<p>Anything over 3% good conversion rate</p>
<p>landing page are more suited for digital products (and take a lot
longer to make) (can later do with say Shogun, zipify pages etc.)</p>
<h3 id="marketing">MARKETING</h3>
<p>Human beings are biologically programmed with 8 main desires:
Survival, food/drink, freedom from danger, sex, comfortable living
conditions, being superior to others, protection of loved ones and
social approval. Ads that target these will be subconsciously
watched</p>
<p>paid traffic and organic traffic (TikTok with someone using your
product. study and recreate competitor videos) AT LEAST $50 A DAY ON
ADS. $150-$200 TO TEST A PRODUCT (does not include $50 for ad creative)
run ads for 4-7 days to test (if perform terribly on day 1, then
probably kill earlier) (have to give time for ad algorithm to optimise
to find your buyers) should get sales within 1-3 days after this 4-7 day
period, choose to scale up or kill of ad-sets (terrible is 0.5% Link
CTR, and $3+ Link CPC maybe only wait 48 hours)</p>
<p>Facebook (includes Instagram) and TikTok (perhaps if targeting
younger audience) (tiktok does not require lots of followers to go
viral, just good content) Start with one platform, Facebook (king for
ecommerce due to data collection and targeted ads) With Facebook, set
feedback score to send after 8 weeks to ensure to not being blocked if
too many bad reviews</p>
<p>Goodle ads, Snapchat and Pinterest aren’t for impulse buyers (perhaps
explore Google ads when doing a branded campaign, e.g. people search for
your website)</p>
<p>If doing influencer marketing stick with theme pages as oppose to
personal brands, e.g. advertise on an instagram themed page?</p>
<p>Writing a blog and loading it up with keywords can drive ad-free
traffic by ranking in google searches. However, long and difficult
process</p>
<p>Need to have video ads first? Hire ad creatives on Fiverr #resources
section</p>
<p>Ad Metrics: INTEREST: * Link CPC (cost per click) how much it costs
for one person to click on your ad? (strive for under $1) * Link CTR how
many people click through to see website after ad (strive for over 1-2%)
(CPC and CTR correlated) ULTIMATE METRIC (if this profitable after 4-7

In general: check if in L1. If not go check in L2 and mark least
recently accessed L1 for move to L2. bubbles up to L3 until need for

<p>Caches, are instruction and data caches combined? What distinct

<p>Anti-trust laws don’t prevent monopolies, they prevent attempts to
monopolise by unfair means, e.g. Microsoft browser market, Apple app
store etc.</p>
<p>Technically, any digital work created is automatically protected by
copyright. So, without a license, people would have to explicitly ask
for permission to use</p>
<p>Permissive (MIT, BSD, Apache, zlib) gives users more freedom to say
relicense, include closed source software, etc. They generally just
enforce attribution Apache like MIT except must state what files you
have changed</p>
<p>Weak copyleft (LPGL) applies to files of library not your entire
codebase, i.e. must still release your version of the library used So,
dynamic linking makes this easier for keeping your source closed If
statically linking, must make a few extra steps to ensure the LGPL parts
are available, e.g. publish object files</p>
<p>Copyleft (GPL) enforces the developers usage of the code. So, any
derivative software must release whole project as GPL, i.e infects your
software (and restricts choice of libraries to GPL) Subsequently
encounter more licensing restrictions.</p>
<p>Creative commons licenses are composed of various attributes. The
default is attribution. They are typically used in artworks,
e.g. images, audio files Other elements are optional and can be combined
together, e.g no derivative, no financial, must share under same
license.</p>
<p>Public domain means no license, so could claim as yours</p>
<h2 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h2>
<p>UUID/GUID (universally/globally) 16 bytes. Typically generated by
concatenating bits of MAC address and timestamp</p>
<p>UEFI firmware interface made to standardise interface between OS and
firmware for purposes of booting</p>
<p>Called /dev/sd as originally for SCSI (small computer system
interface; standards for transferring data between computers and
devices) The preceding letter indicates the order in which it’s found,
e.g. /dev/sda first found The preceding number indicates the partition
number, e.g. and /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2</p>
<p>UEFI use of GPT (GUID partition table) incorporates CRC to create
more recoverable boot environment over BIOS MBR (located in first sector
of disk) Furthermore, UEFI has more addressable memory in 64-bit mode as
oppose to only 16-bit mode Also, UEFI supports networking The ESP (EFI
system partition) will have EGI entries that point to a UUID of where to
boot one of these will be grub binary like shimx64.efi NOTE: The
bootloader is the EFI OS loader and is part of the OS that will load the
kernel</p>
<p>ACPI interface to pass information from firmware to OS. This firmware
will have hardware information baked into it set by manufacturers</p>
<p>Each CPU socket have memory banks that are local to it, i.e. can be
accessed from it directly. NUMA (non-uniform memory access) means that
accessing memory from a non-local bank will not be the same speed. A
NUMA-aware OS will try to mitigate these accesses</p>
<p>Common transistor size is 7nm. Low as 2nm Silicon atom is 0.2nm From
gleaning a Moore’s law transistor graph, see that average CPU a few
billion transistors and high end SOCs around 50 billion transistors</p>
<p>TDP (thermal design power) maximum amount of heat (measure in watts)
at maximum load that is designed to be dissipated (bus sizes of chips
smaller, so TDP getting lower) However, value is rather vague as could
be measured on over-clock and doesn’t take into account ambient
conditions</p>
<p>Cache eats up precious die-area. Having a large cache increases
lookup time</p>
<p>SRAM is fast, requires 6 transistors for each bit. So, for 64MB
cache, 3.2billion transistors. Sizeable percentage of die-area DRAM is 1
transistor per bit</p>
<p>Average CPU die-size is 100mm², GPU much larger as benefits from
parallelisation around 500mm²</p>
<p>direct-mapped cache has each memory address mapping to a single cache
line lookup is instantenous, however high replacement inefficiences
fully-associative cache has each memory address mapping to any cache
line entire cache has to be searched, however low replacement
inefficiencies set-associative cache divides cache into blocks of
fully-associative. the number of cache lines in a block is what say an
8-way cache means this compromises between the efficiency and lookup
speed</p>
<p>Caches will stay relatively small due to the nature of how computers
are used. At any point, there is only a small amount of local data the
CPU will process next. So, beyond the sweet spot of 64MB, having a
larger cache will marginally better hit ratio.</p>
<h2 id="formats">Formats</h2>
<p>Inodes store file metadata. The metadata stored by an inode is
determined by filesystem in use, except for filename which is never
stored Typical metadata includes size, permissions, data pointer NOTE:
FAT32 won’t store permissions, last modification time, no journaling or
soft-links</p>
<p>A filename maps to an inode. Therefore a directory is a mapping of
filenames to inodes</p>
<p>A hardlink references an inode, and is therefore impervious to file
name change, deletion, etc. A softlink is to a file name</p>
<p>Journaling is the process of regularly writing operations that are to
be performed in RAM to disk area of memory known as journal. then apply
these changes to disk when necessary this overhead makes them slower,
but more robust on crashes as can read journal to ascertain whether
certain operations finished performing</p>
<p>FAT for ESP (because FAT simple, open source, low-overhead and
supported virtually everywhere) vFAT is driver (typically for FAT32)</p>
<p>EXT4 for system (supports larger file sizes) (NTFS microsoft
proprietary) Most filesystems will use a self-balancing tree to index
files</p>
<h2 id="unix">Unix</h2>

<p>A premptive scheduler will swap processes based on specific criteria.
Round-robin means each process will run for a designated time slice CFS
is a premptive round-robin scheduler. Time slices are dynamic, computed
like <code>((1/N) * (niceness))</code> Processes are managed using a
RB-Tree. Therefore, cost of launching a process or a context switch is
logarithmic (kernel will have internal tick rate that updates waiting
threads. lowering this will increase granularity however will increase
CPU time and hence battery time as more time spent in kernel code)</p>
<p>System level refers to inbetween kernel and userspace, e.g. network
manager Systemd is a collection of system binaries, e.g. udev Primarily,
systemd is a service manager A service extends the functionality of
daemons, e.g. only start after another service, restart on failure after
10s etc. The kernel will launch systemd init service that will then
bootstrap into userspace (hence alllowing for the aforementioned service
features)</p>
<p>Kernel offers various methods of process isolation, e.g. chroot,
cgroups etc. (chroot cannot access files outside its designated tree) A
container will utilise one of these options provided by the kernel to
acheive: * cannot send signals to processes outside container * has own
networking namespace * resource usage limits</p>
<p>.deb and .rpm are binary packages. Annoyances arise due to specifying
the specific library dependency for each distro version Flatpaks and
Snaps are containerised applications that include the specific libraries
and runtimes AppImages combine the ‘shared’ libraries and runtimes of
Flatpaks and Snaps into a giant file. This file can be copied and run on
any distro If packages is being actively maintained, preferable to use
.deb as faster and simpler</p>

<p>LiPo is lithium-ion poly. uses polymer electrolyte instead of liquid.
lipo more expensive, shorter lifespan, less energy, more robust li-poly
battery is rechargeable (so rechargeable is structured to allow a
current to be passed to it to reverse the process) battery will have two
electrodes, say lithium cobalt oxide (cathode) and graphite (anode,
negative) graphite is almost always used as anode when charging, lithium
ions move to graphite when discharging, lithium ions move from graphite
to lithium so, we can see that the atomic structure of the electrodes
are changed, hence why charge cycles affect battery life LiPo is
lithium-ion poly. uses polymer electrolyte instead of liquid. lipo more
expensive, shorter lifespan, less energy, more robust</p>
<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>
<p>eMMC is the interface as well eMMC precursor to SD. TF (transflash)
more commonly known as micro-SD card cheaper than SSD, yet slower still
uses NAND flash technology</p>
<p>QSPI can be used without CPU with data queues</p>
<h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2>
<p>cpu contains clock. each tick marks a step in the fetch(signal sent
along address bus as specified by PC; instruction or data sent along
data bus)- so, whenever interacting with memory, will first have to
specify address bus and get/store result via data bus therefore, for
something like LDR rax, [val] will require two fetch-executes. this is
von-neumann bottleneck most modern computers are modified-harvard, in
that the L1 caches have separate instruction and data regions.
therefore, they can be read simultaneously</p>
<p>decode-execute cycle an accumulator register is term used to indicate
typical register that holds results of large arithmetic</p>
<p>von-neumann instruction, data in RAM instructions+data share data bus
between CPU and RAM, so they have to be fetched separately</p>
<p>harvard instruction, data separate</p>
<p>in reality, all CPUs are von-neumann presented to the user and
harvard at the low-level. it’s only harvard from the pipeline/cache
stage modified harvard could also mean instruction and data bus, but
unified memory so, the variation amongst harvard architectures is in how
one transitions to the other</p>
<p>Procedure Call Standard for the Arm Architecture (AAPCS). Part of ABI
for ARM (also part of ABI is debugging, dynamic linking semantics etc.)
From this we can garner say, not to put more than 4 word sized arguments
to function as this will require stack, consuming more time and space
Furthermore, alignment restrictions mean that passing a double word has
to be even-odd register pair, so ordering of parameters important So,
call standard important for ordering and number of parameters?</p>
<p>When people say vector operations, they mean SIMD</p>
<p>endianness only relevent when reading and writing to memory addresses
and interpreting the bytes overall, endianness usefulness determined by
majority of operations performed, e.g. converting string to int easier
in big-endian e.g. little-endian easier to read values of variable
length (address does not change)</p>
<p>CISC gives reduced cache pressure for high-intensive, sustained loops
Instructions with higher cycle count Typically a register-memory
architecture, e.g. can add one value in register, one in memory (as
oppose to load-store)</p>
<p>memory model: visibility and consistency of changes to data stored in
memory necessary for understanding multiple thread execution</p>
<p>alignment ensures that value doesn’t straddle cache line
boundaries</p>
<p>SystemV ABI: IMPORTANT: cannot easily access upper portion of
register, only lower rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9 (6 integer arguments)
xmm0, xmm1, xmm2, xmm3, xmm4, xmm5, xmm6 (7 floating arguments)
remaining arguments pushed right-to-left on stack rax return and syscall
number stack 16-byte aligned before function call (SSE2 is baseline for
x86-64, so make efficient for __m128)? (word size 8 bytes?)</p>
<p>more instructions required for unaligned memory accesses? (most
modern x64 arm will not crash on an unaligned access?) from armv7,
unaligned accesses allowed</p>
<p>hardware (from machine code to execution on the CPU): * sequential
consistency (ideal as easy to understand, however doesn’t maximise
hardware speed) * x86-TSO (total store order). each processor reads from
shared memory all processors agree upon the order in which their write
queues are written to memory write queue is FIFO, so write queue is
flushed in same order as seen by the processor however, when the write
queue is flushed is up to the CPU therefore, to enforce stronger memory
ordering, architecture supplies memory barriers/fences (in a sense to
enforce sequentially consistent behaviours) to ensure write queue is
flushed before any future reads occur (without fences, I suppose write
queue length would determine whether certain synchronisation problems
occur more frequently) * ARM (most relaxed) each processor reads and
writes from its own copy of memory writes propagate to other processors
independently, i.e not all update at same time furthermore, the order of
the writes can be reordered furthermore, processors are allowed to delay
reads until writes later in the instruction stream</p>
<p>language (from source to machine code) so, C11 memory model is in
relation to rearranging of loads/stores in assembly for optimisations?
(so is a weak model?) mainly in reference to the behaviour of atomics to
synchronise programs so, language memory model will abstract away

<h1 id="the-scripting-awakening">The Scripting Awakening</h1>
<p>I decided to try and implement ctime in Bash for pedagogical
purposes. My first task was to write and read a binary file. Googling
how to do this in Bash returned the consensus, “use another language”.
Often when I read this, I’m not deterred. I have encountered similar
naysayers before when it comes to directly using Xlib. However, when it
came to wanting structures to read and write to (essential for binary
work), I found Bash was empty. With this understanding, I realised more
generally that the usefulness of scripting languages are limited.
Specifically, they should be limited to basic tasks that involve
searching or external tool usage. I suppose my biggest use case of Bash
is for enhancing my terminal (.bashrc) and vim (<code>:.!</code>)
interactions. C is a simple language and if you understand it’s
low-level capabilities, you can do many things. However, despite this
recognition, I did come upon certain procedures to follow when working
with Bash scripts.</p>

<p>The diverse software landscape of Linux distros means that we don’t
know what version of each</p>
<p>STM32CubeMX (this justs generates code, IDE is full fledged) to
download, must get link with email. STM32CubeIDE is woefully slow.
Maximising to full screen just blurs out half Once installed, a series
of pop-up menus just keep appearing spontaneously as it has to download
more to satisfy a simple create project To download qtcreator well known
bug that it selects the wrong mirror, 3MBps to 30kbs. Have to decipher
command line arguments and mirror parsing,
e.g. ./qt-unified-linux-x64-4.3.0-1-online.run –mirror
http://ftp.jaist.ac.jp/pub/qtproject</p>
<p>My god, installing cubemx is awful. require email. password setting
for account fails.</p>
<p>QTcreator does not honour system .gdbinit file, have to manually set
breakpoints and dissassembly flavour QTCreator doesn’t show console
output. Tick ‘run in terminal’ crashes on startup</p>
<p>Before even using the program, installing is bad. Install pandoc. It
requires a pdf engine, e.g. xelatex that must be separately installed
Which name is not found with traditional
<code>sudo apt install xelatex</code>, it’s in
<code>texlive-xetex</code> and is 100MB… Searching for the appropriate
package name to install a missing dependency is what I use ubuntu stack
exchange mostly for…..</p>
<p>Firefox just forces restart</p>
<p>gpus have introduced a whole host of undocumented NDA annoyances</p>
<p>sound output varies significantly across different hardware. so, to
detect possible sound bugs we may need to invest in a good piece of
sound hardware</p>
<p>in linux, x11 is mixer for drm, pulse a mixer for alsa (more
flexibility with pulse, e.g. can disable it if only needing one
application at time, or can redirect it to another sound card) audio is
a mess in linux</p>
<p>due to disconnected nature of x11 and scheduling, must vsync.
sleeping isn’t an option due default to round-robin scheduling policy
(switching to real-time scheduling is not suitable for general-os). we
could improve by setting niceness (however must be sudo) as not real
time, we can’t control a lot of things, e.g. could be USB latency, adobe
photoshop in background, etc. on say raspberry pi could program GPIO
pins to have a accurate poll for a joystick.</p>
<p>sound on linux is absurd (tribal knowledge). even the people on the
mailing list don’t know how it works. constantly saying, don’t do this,
use a library… often times, source code is the documentation, so good
luck spending months on how to operate low level. return when threading
is involved.</p>
<p>x11 is more complicated than it needs to be. like many OS commands,
it should do a lot of the dirty work for you, as no-one knows all the
minutiae. it’s bad to think that OSs are getting harder to work with.
however, it is unfair to pick on X11, as their are other apis (even
modern) that are just as bad, even worse. x11 is particular annoying in
that if it crashes, even launching a virtual terminal may not work as
keys aren’t registered</p>
<p>if only eclispe cdt debugger was good. it terminates for no reason
when running (can sometimes be fixed by switching to run mode and then
back to debug). sometimes have to restart to fix. run-to-line doesn’t
work when inside sub-routine. memory browser crashes on entering
address. doesn’t give information on stack overflows.</p>
<p>firefox will unexpectanctly say we updated in the background and you
must restart or tab crashed etc.</p>
<p>Online help forums for QTCreator useless. In reality, only core devs
would be able to answer your question thoroughly So, this is where I see
the benefit of mailing lists</p>
<p>Often Ubuntu audio mixer just stops working and generates fuzz and
have to restart</p>
<p>Firefox facebook video chat. For some reason just mysteriously stops
working. says to restart, did that work, nope! both rev every fucking
second is probably why.</p>
<p>Unfortunate just resign yourself to choosing the software with fewest
or manageable ‘quirks’ (bugs to offensive…)</p>
<p>How on earth can something so frequently used like TeX have such
poor/cryptic parsing error information Furthermore, pandoc doesn’t treat
text as text. If different file extension, will perform different
parsing e.g. inserts ‘hidden’ YAML header if markdown file</p>
<p>FreeCAD have to click in particular order for symmetry,
e.g. point-line-point</p>
<p>QTcreator so complicated to run cross-debugger, have to write down
steps</p>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee envisioned a universal place for information
exchange. Unfortunately the freedom of creativity has resulted in much
of the Web being intrusive and hindering</p>
<p>Order of arguments matter in docker, for some reason –rm must be
before -it</p>
<p>default firefox credential store overwrote bitwarden password.
ugh</p>
<p>Have so many Ubuntu variants when in reality just different packages
installed (possibly different kernel parameters), e.g. mate, xubuntu,
lbuntu, studio</p>
<p>Ad division of companies seem to have greatest control over

<p>240V/50Hz mains. oscilloscope default noise is mains (200MHz,

really only applicable for perhaps a logic gate or 0.1hz square wave)

probe compensation; similar to banana plugs in multimeter not being
plugged in correctly) Continous triggering enables us to view from start

trigger point, i.e. start in centre of screen No real issue with
oscilloscope blowing up if testing battery powered/isolated DC power

<p>math -&gt; decoder on; event table on (make sure zoomed out enough to

increase baud also)</p>
<p>single-shot triggering contact bounce first then ringing as stablises
(makes it a balancing act between selecting triggering level for button
press and release) Multimeter measure power consumption of MCU? (stm32

completely bottom out)</p>

<p>https://c3.handmade.network/blog/p/8486-the_case_against_a_c_alternative</p>
<p>instead of feature, we introduce a patented terminology like user
stories to have someone teach you them. slows down development business
logic …. just means high-order operations in say main()</p>
<p>Incessent unit-testing, why not test startup assembly then. Falls
apart… What not to test, e.g. assume that hex_to_bin() simple enough to
work? Introducing formulas to determine whether or not to automate
something….</p>
<p>certain ‘design pattern’ enforce really long names to conform to
pattern. any competent programmer can read use-case specific functions
with clearer names
“test_CommandHardware_CheckForMsg_Should_GetCharAndAddToPacker_When_BytesAvailable”</p>
<p>file for every test, file for every class. leads to awful build
times</p>
<p>How can software better serve humanity? e.g. bloatware causes
slowness for aus post workers</p>
<p>With UML if doing sufficiently complex to the same level as a
blueprint, may as well have just written the program the idea of
iterative design would be followed by literal architects, however too
costly and time consuming. with software, we have the ability to do
this. 1. design (urban planner): separation of code (mental clarity and
division of labour) design metrics are temporal coupling (physics
outputs data to renderer, so format is important), layout coupling
(renderer inherits from opengl), idealogical coupling (threading, width,
memory), fluidity (one change to system causes a major crash) 2.
programming (architect) 3. compiler (builder)</p>
<p>Most design patterns are just utility classes rather than a way to
architect a program</p>
<p>I don’t want to fight the language (Java). Higher level languages
should allow you to easily express cpu instructions</p>
<p>reject the idea of TDD driving good design. accept that tests
validate design. tdd and bdd have good elements in them, but the dogma
is not effective.</p>
<p>code shouldn’t take longer than 10 seconds to compile.</p>
<p>in general we don’t add security threats that weren’t already
present, e.g. loading from shared object could just as easily override
binary if have write priveleges to both</p>
<p>even though a ‘new’ language won’t crash, it can still have buffer
overruns. NullPtrExceptions</p>
<p>c++ struct functions implicitly have a this pointer. virtual
functions will result in a vtable (array of function pointers) to be
generated for that struct. therefore, virtual function will first go to
vtable, then lookup in function, so double indirection (so not a
zero-cost abstraction) normal function call just call 0x1234, however
with vtable mov rax, qword ptr [rsp + 20] etc. (dereferencing
pointers)</p>
<p>an engine makes things that aren’t likely to be difficult easy
(except for linux…) important to know low-level to write new tools. we
don’t have a wheel yet.</p>
<p>for any non-trival task, scripting languages become a hindrance with
no static type checking, no real debugger, slow, not as capable. there
are complications in software we have wrongly convinced ourselves are
necessary, e.g. scripting for hotloading hotloading C is far superior,
as C is more powerful and can use same debugger (using Lua is a
downgrade) build systems can be useful as they allow for incremental
builds (however, in negatively reinforces people to only make small
changes) (speed increase may only be noticeable for large, complex code
base) they are also useful for managing cross compilation (libraries
have to be pulled in and compile also) the idea of incorporating a
scripting language into a game was a failed experiment in 2005s. things
like a visual based interface is fine as it is constrained</p>
<p>with closed source it is often the case that a company employs
someone to oversee the experience of the software and have q+a
therefore, better quality with this higher layer of checking than open
source.</p>
<p>the best bet in safeguarding security is to reduce the attack
surface, which means to reduce the number of lines of code.</p>
<p>Don’t restrict right side of bell curve Let your aces be aces Being
an ace involves having an opinion Most influential software written
largely by one person, e.g Linux, Unix, git etc. Then a team is assigned
to maintain it. Fallacy about solo programmer productivity requiring
large teams. Design by committee pushes design to middle of bell curve
as opposing views average out</p>
<p>templates add complexity in the debugger (no actual names). only
really useful if you save a ton of code (not much code to just write
each implementation) if templates are necessary then just use
meta-programming as it is much more powerful.</p>
<p>many programs treat memory as an infinite resource. allocating memory
is introducing a failure case and making not a fan of allocation
festivals. we can create our application with minimal failure cases
(cannot do this with the platform layer).</p>
<p>uml and diagrams in general are a waste of time (its just code you
would write and often fails to capture subtleties) you should become
more proficient at reading code and understanding its relationship.</p>
<p>oh no, we had a security bug in our development version! (printf and
friends. printf %f defaults to double)</p>
<p>understanding history is important; c runtime library way of packing
return fail information is the reason for inverse truthniess</p>
<p>downloading unverified external tool, always good to get more viruses
on my machine… unless playing at EVO with some maxed out razer device,
not feasible to hit that hard I guess RTFM is the answer to that…</p>
<p>build tools are more of a hindrance! always asking yourself what
flags are being passed (linker and compiling separate steps), what files
are it picking up, what is the CWD, etc.</p>
<p>Go against merge requests from strangers and just auto let a group of
trusted people. This avoids the problem where you work for hours only to
have it blocked</p>
<p>Many online communities are anti-engineering in that they don’t
embrace criticism.</p>
<p>Do anything on web takes a lot longer than it should dealing with a
myriad of software with different odd conventions. Lack of
functionality/integration with hardware will lead to collapse Many
features lacking like type system, try to emulate. Many features have
like garbage collection try to avoid.</p>
<p>Scripting languages can cause heap fragmentation. Why just use a real
language as we want robustness (scripting languages dependent on
interpreter speed) and type checking</p>
<p>Fundamental lack of awareness that there is a better way to program.
We all make slow because of lack of time however to say it can’t be done
is a fallacy. The cultural differences with these people make it a
fool’s errand to try and get these people to program correctly e.g. time
visual studio users think is fast is less than 10 seconds?!</p>
<p>Const rarely finds bugs that I have, i.e..writing to a variable a
shouldn’t. In saying that, you should use features of language that
helps you catch bugs.</p>
<p>Apple store is hardly a free marketplace. They can just block your
app for any reason</p>
<p>DRM and engine usage make using games in the future difficult
(e.g. museum)</p>
<p>Also, the excessive testing is pushed by web where the poor languages
dictate heavy testing. Testing first makes no sense as the app may
change</p>
<p>Audiophiles think they hear things that aren’t there</p>
<p>Much like the food industry has organic vs processed, we need a term
for games that are made by people who love games and care about the
experience as opposed to large companies concerned with making money
(indie vs triple a)</p>
<p>Sometimes crashing is good because it signifies the serious problem
that can be rectified immediately rather than some other Insidious

<p>The flip side of high level languages is loss of capability in

<p>C was created to solve the problem of a portable high level assembly
language for UNIX. C++ is a frankenstein languAge with bjarne just
adding features in, e.g. he just wanted c with classes. Go and rust were
designed for specific purposes, although I don’t care about safe memory
features or want garbage collection. Complexity creates bugs. C++
incredibly complex. People just stick to a subset of c++, which may be
different to yours. Exceptions defer error handling and also bring about
an ethos of more errors when they should just be states of your
program.</p>

important part and will constrain the system. Java huge call stack to
make a http request. Make lightweight abstractions only Functional
programming - Haskell around since 1990 hasn’t taken over. Imperative
more clear. Functional breaks down over non trivial work Data hiding -
poor cache performance, redundant code Excessive inheritance - poor
cache performance Exceptions - constant cognitive tax on remembering
what throws what and huge verbosity doing so. Also don’t know what
program will throw during some time Commenting - write good comments and
garden them as they can rot easily Re-use - only effective when used to

e.g. gmail is incredibly slow and littered with bugs (typing in a name
gives wrong result as it hasn’t finished time to server) so they use
these technologies that help to get something working quickly but will

enjoyable to use. Web needs to acknowledge this. They have different
thinking, e.g. network latency so we don’t have to care about
performance, no you need more effort to avoid this latency! Although
different tradeoffs made for different contexts, on a whole programming
is programming. The web is almost impossible to write good software as

<p>vector math routines (obtaining cross product from column vector
form) when drawing vectors in a physical sense, keep in mind they are
rooted at the origin (even if drawings show them across time) whenever
doing vector addition/subtraction, remember the head-to-tail rule (their
direction is determined by their sign). could also think that subtract
whenever you want to ‘go away’ from something dot product transpose
notation useful for emulating matrix multiplication unit circle, x =
cosθ dot product allows us to project a vector’s length onto a unit
vector dot product allows us to measure a vector on any axis system we
want by setting up two unit vectors that are orthogonal to each other
simple plane equation with d=0 will be through origin (altering d shifts
the plane up/down) cross product gives vector that is orthogonal to the
plane that the two original vectors lie on (length is |a|·|b|·sinθ). So,
really only works in at least 3 dimensions with units, e.g. for camera,
start with arbitrary ‘unit’ defintion. later move onto more physical
things like metres by applying a scaling factor to direction vector, can
move along it world space coordinates. camera position is based on
these. the camera will have its own axis system which we determine what
it should be and then use cross product based on what we want
understanding dot product equivalence with circle equation for
multiplication of vectors, be explicit with a hadamard function
(IMPORTANT have reciprocal square root approximation which is there
specifically for normalisation. much faster cycle count and latency than
square root)</p>

<p>Before cpus increased in single thread execution speed. Now more
cores. It’s a topic of research to convert single threaded into
multithreaded for emulation. This is why emulation of something like the

that programs relied on may take hundreds of instructions to emulate If
actually a simple translation, then should run close to native speed.

<p>if apple computers use RISC ARM in M1, why CISC necessary? (only
because on Intel?) emphasis of CISC simplify assembly (e.g. more
addressing modes), thereby reducing size of binary? (reduce
instructions) and increase cache coherency RISC will require less
transistors to implement complex hardware but will make optimising
harder for compiler? single cycle instructions (reduce cycles per
instruction)</p>
<p>when looking at a pointer, to optimise compiler must know whether it
can assume it points to a local var or not. so, easier to eliminate

<p>Unless your in web where everything takes years to load, as single
threaded performance is largely stagnant you will have to utilise
parallelism if want performance. This is very difficult and like single
threaded code generic libraries which can actually be very specific will
create bloated in performing code based. Multithreading is building up a
new discipline to single threaded. There are a lot of pitfalls for
performance (balancing want things local, however must share to utilise)
If you care about performance for anything, you should care about cache
misses Memory bandwidth and caches are major reasons for a cup attaining
performance. You have to think about where does memory actually live and
how is it transferred around</p>
<p>Optimiser allows for lexical scoping of stack variables. However, for
optimiser to inline will have to get rid of pointers to prevent
aliasing</p>
<p>stack and heap memory are the same physical thing, so only more
efficient if memory was hot, i.e. recently touched</p>
<p>Computer faster than you think, e.g instructions, clock cycles,
cores. Very large With M2 drive should be quick</p>
<p>may be easier for optimising compiler to work with things passed by
value as oppose to pointer. so, if need to modify something may have to
return the value in a functional programming style. however, this is
error prone. compiler cannot optimise pointers, e.g. if setting two
values to same pointer, compiler cannot say that both the values are the
same as another pointer may point to the same address. this is
aliasing.</p>
<p>we see contiguous memory in virtual memory, however in physical
memory it is almost certainly going to be fragmented</p>
<p>compilers can auto-vectorize loops for us (and other operations if we
perform say 20 of them). so, floats will be twice as fast as doubles
(more space, even though same latency and throughput)</p>
<p>optimising is a very precise process. only do when you have code that
is working and you know will keep. games by their very nature are about
responsiveness, so optimisation and low-latency is important. I like
programming with this as a mentality.</p>
<p>with pure compiler optimisations, i.e. code we have not optimised
ourselves, a 2x increase is not unexpected. (code we optimised not as
much)</p>
<p>optimise for worst case (looking out on whole world) not best case
(in front of wall, don’t render what is behind). we care about highest
framerate, not lowest.</p>
<p>virtually never use lookup tables as ram memory is often 100x slower
(so unless you can’t compute in 100 of instructions)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Optimisation (this is rarely done due to time involved) Do
back-of-envelope calculations; look at algorithm to see if wasteful;
benchmark to see if hitting theoretical calculations and then use
timings etc. to isolate why our code isn’t hitting these theoretical
numbers Very importantly need to know what the theoretical maximum is,
which will be dependent on the program, e.g bounded by number of bytes
sent to graphics card, kernel stdout etc.</li>
<li>Non-pessimisation (do this all the time) Don’t introduce unecessary
work (interpreter; complex libraries; constructs like
polymorphism/classes people have convinced themselves are necessary) for
the CPU to do to solve the problem</li>
<li>Fake optimisation (very bad philosophy) Repeating context-specific
statements e.g. use memcpy as it’s optimised (however the speed of
something is so context specific, so non-statement), arrays are faster
than linked lists (again, so dependent on what your usage patterns are)
IMPORTANT: In programming, preface the suitability of something to a
particular environment/context</li>
</ol>
<p>When many people say too much effort involved in optimisation, they
are generally thinking of point 1</p>
<p>sometimes things should be running faster than they should, however
only so much we can replace e.g. the structure of many OSs are based on
legacy code, so simply outputting to stdout may go through shell then
kernel etc. also, may have to deal with pessimised libraries. in these
cases: * isolate bad code, i.e. draw hard boundary between your code and
theirs by caching calls to them * do as little modification to the data
coming in from them (no need to say put in a string class etc.)</p>
<p>People think that it’s slow, but it won’t crash (because of
interpreter) Performance is critical in getting people excited about
what you do, e.g. windows ce was laggy, iphone performant but less
features changes the market low latency is more desirable, even if less
features</p>
<p>count number of math ops in function and control flow logic that is
evaluated branches can get problematic if they’re unpredictable</p>
<p>inspecting measurements of microarchitecture consider latency and
throughtput (how much does it cost to start again) so, FMUL may have
latency of 11, however throughput of 0.5, so can start 2 every cycle,
i.e. issue again (cpus these days are incredibly overlapped even if
single-threaded) so throughput is more of what we care about for
sustained execution, e.g. in a loop</p>
<p>however, these numbers are all assuming the data is in the chip. it’s
just as important to see how long it takes to get data to the chip. look
at cache parameters for microarchitecture; how many cycles to get from
l1 cache, l2 cache, etc. when get to main memory potentially hundreds of
cycles</p>
<p>bandwidth of L1 cache say is 80 bytes/cycle, so can get 20 floats per
cycle (however, based on size of L1 cache, not really sustainable for
large data)</p>
<p>http://igoro.com/archive/gallery-of-processor-cache-effects/</p>
<p>(could just shortcut this and just see if flops is recorded for our
chip)</p>
<p>so, using these rough numbers we should be able to look at an
algorithm (and dissect what operations it’s performing, like FMULs),
know how much data it’s taking, and give a rough estimate as to how long
it could optimally take (will never hit optimal however) IT’S CRITICAL
TO KNOW HOW FAST SOMETHING SHOULD RUN</p>
<p>REASONS SOFTWARE IS SLOW: 1. No back-of-envelope calculations (people
aren’t concerned that they are running up to 1000 times slower thn what
the hardware is capable of) These calculations involve say looking at
number of math ops to be performed in the algoirthm and comparing that
to the perfect hardware limit 2. Reusing code (20LOC is a lot; use
things that do what you want to do, but not in the way you want them to
be done; often piling up code that is ill-fitting to what the task was,
e.g. we know this isn’t a regular ray cast, it’s a ray cast that is
always looking down) 3. When writing, thinking of goals ancillary to
task (not many places taught how to actually write code; all high level
abstractions about clean code there are thinking about templates/classes
etc. not just what does the computer actually have to do to do this
task?) (there is no metric for clean code; it’s just some fictional
thing people made up)</p>
<p>WHENEVER UNDERSTANDING CODE EXAMPLES: 1. COMPILE AND STEP INTO (NOT
OVER) IN DEBUGGER AND MAKE HIGH LEVEL STEPS PERFORMED look at these
steps for duplicated/unecessary work (may pollute cache). (perhaps even
asking why was the code written the way it was) could we gather things
up in a prepass, i.e. outside of loop? if allocating memory each cycle
that’s game over for performance. do we actually have to perform the
same action to get the same result, e.g. a full raycast is not
necessary, just segment on grid O(n·m) is multiplicative, not linear
O(n). big oh is just indication of how it scales. could be less given
some input threshold (big oh ignores constants, hence looking at
aymptotic behaviour, i.e. limiting behaviour) now, once code reduced,
look at minimising number of ops</p>
<p>cpu front end is figuring out what work it has to do,
i.e. instruction decoding</p>
<p>e.g simd struct is 288 bytes, 4.5 cache lines, able to store 8
triangles</p>
<p>understanding assembly language is essential in understanding why the
code might not be performing well</p>
<p>branch prediction necessary to ensure that the front-end can keep
going and not have to wait on the back-end</p>
<p>execution ports execute uops. however, the days of assembly language
registers actually mapping to real registers is gone. instead, the
registers from the uops are passed through a register allocation table
(if we have say 16 general purpose registers, table has about 192
entries; so a lot more) in the back-end this is because in many
programs, things can happen in any order. so to take advantage of this,
the register allocation table stores dependency chains of operations
(wikichips.org for diagram) from execution port, could be fed back into
scheduler or to load/store in actual memory</p>
<p>when looking at assembly, when we say from memory, we actually mean
from the L1 cache</p>
<p>xmm is a sse register (4 wide, 16 bytes); m128 is a memory operand of
128 bits ymm is 8 wide 1<em>p01 + 1</em>p23 is saying issue 1 microop on
either port0 or port1 and one microop on either port2 or port3 so, we
could issue the same instruction multiple times, i.e. throughput of
0.5</p>
<p>microop fusion is where a microop doesn’t count for your penalty as
it’s fused with another. with combined memory ops,
e.g. <code>vsubps ymm8, ymm3, ymmword ptr [rdx]</code> this is the case
so, if a compiler were to separate this out into a mov and then a sub,
not only does this put unecessary strain on the front-end decoder it
also removes microop fusion as they are now separate microops (important
to point out that I’m not the world best optimiser, or the worlds best
optimisers assistant, so perhaps best not to outrightly say bad codegen,
just say makes nervous)</p>
<p>godbolt.org good for comparing compiler outputs and possible
detecting a spurious load etc.</p>
<p>macrop fusion is where you have an instruction that the front-end
will handle for you, e.g. add and a jne will merge to addjne which will
just send the 1 microp of add through</p>
<p>uica.uops.info gives percentage of time instruction was on a port
(this is useful for determining bottle-necks, e.g. series of
instructions all require port 1 and 2, so cannot paralleise easily) so,
although best case say is issue instruction every 4 cycles, this
bottleneck will give higher throughput</p>
<p>some levels of abstraction are necessary and good, e.g. higher level
languages to assembly</p>

<p>likely() macros for branch prediction compiler optimisations
(https://akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf, pg 56)</p>
<p>recording information: We want to understand where slow with vtune,
amd uprof, arm performance reports Next, determine if IO bound, memory
bound etc.</p>
<p>To determine performance must have some stable metric, e.g. ops/sec
to compare to e.g measure total time and number of operations
Hyper-threading useful in alleviating memory latency, e.g. one thread is
waiting to get content from RAM, the other hyper-thread can execute
However, as we are not memory bound (just going through pixel by pixel
and not generating anything intermediate; will all probably stay in L1
cache), we are probably saturating the core’s ALUs, so hyper-threading
not as useful</p>
<p>Inspecting the assembly of our most expensive loop, we see that
rand() is not inlined and is a call festival. This must be replaced
Essentially we are looking for mathematical functions that could be
inlined and aren’t that are in our hot-path. When you want something to
be fast, it should not be calling anything. If it does, probably made a
mistake Also note that using SIMD instructions, however not to their
widest extent, i.e. single scalar ‘ss’. Want to replace with ‘ps’ packed
scalar</p>
<p>we have the option of constructor/destructor pairs if we want to
determine best possible time if all caches align etc. ‘hunt for
mininum’, e.g. record mininum time execution in loop iteration or re-run
if smaller time yielded alternatively, we could develop a statistical
breakdown of values (could see moments when kernel switches us out
etc.)</p>
<p>(IMPORTANT save out configuration and timing information for various
optimisation stages, e.g. ./app &gt; 17-04-2022-image.txt)</p>
<p>agnerfog optimise website ‘what’s a creel’</p>
<p>threading Observe CPU percentage use is not close to 100% For
multithreading, often have to pack into 64 bit value to perform single
operation on it,
e.g. <code>delta = (val1 &lt;&lt; 32 | val2); interlocked_add(&amp;val, delta)</code></p>
<p>When making multi-threaded, segregate task by writing prototype
‘chunk’ function, e.g. <code>render_tile</code> Then write a for loop
combining these chunk functions Before entering the chunk function, good
to have a configuration printout, e.g. num chunks, num cores, chunk dim,
chunk size, etc.</p>
<p>When dividing a whole into pieces, an uneven divisor will give less
than what’s needed. so <code>(total + divisor - 1) / divisor</code> to
ensure always enough. We will want this calculation to be in the last
dividing operation, e.g. tile_width then tile_count calculated, so use
on tile_count Associated with this calculation is clamping to handle
adding extra exceeding original dimensions For getting proper place in
chunk, call function wrapper for pointer location per row</p>
<p>(May have to inline functions?) Next we want to pass each chunk onto
a queue and then dequeue them from each logical core? So, have a
WorkOrder that will store all information required to perform operation
on chunk, i.e. all parameters in <code>render_chunk</code> function (may
also store entropy for each chunk, i.e. random number series) Then a
WorkQueue that contains an array of WorkOrders with total number
equalling number of chunks So, the original loop iterating of chunks now
just populates the WorkOrders Now in a while loop that runs while there
are still chunks to execute, we call the <code>render_chunk</code>
function and pass in the WorkQueue The <code>render_chunk</code>
function will increment the next_work_order_index and return true if
more to be done</p>
<p>When spawning the actual worker thread functions, have same while
loop calling the <code>render_chunk</code> function as for core 0 (the
amount of threads to spawn would think should be equal to number of
logical cores? however exceeding them may increase performance?) (this
debate of manually prescribing the core count applies to the chunk size
as well. perhaps the sweet-spot for my machine in balancing context
switching and drain out is to manually prescribe their size as oppose to
computing them off the core count) (Collating information into the
WorkQueue struct helsp for printing out configuration) (Setting up this
way, we can easily turn multithreading off)</p>
<p>As creating threads will require platform specific, put prototypes in
main.h and the implementations in linux_main.cpp Then include
linux_main.cpp based on macro definition of platform in the build script
at the bottom of main.cpp</p>
<p>hyperthreading, architecture specific information becomes more
important when in a situation where memory is constrained in relation to
the cache (hyper-threads share same L1-L2 cache)</p>
<p>volatile says code other than what is generated by this compiler run,
could modify this value. it’s required for multithreaded, as compiler
may not re-read value that it may have cached in a register if changed
elsewhere when incrementing volatiles, must use a
locked_add_and_return_previous_value (could return new value, just be
clear)</p>
<p>simd clamp can be re-written as min() and max() combination, which
are instructions in SSE Although looking at the system monitor shows
cpus maxed out, we could be wasting cycles, e.g. not using SIMD</p>
<p>Define lane width, and divide with this to get the new loop count Go
through loop and loft used values e.g. lane_r32, lane_v3, lane_u32
(IMPORTANT at first we are only concerned with getting single values to
work, later can worry about n-wide loading of values) (TODO the current
code has the slots for each lane generated, rather than unpacked. look
at handmade hero for this unpacking mode) If parameters to functions,
loft them also (not functions? just parameters? however we do
random_bilateral_lane() so yes to functions?) If using struct or struct
member references, take out values and loft them also,
e.g. sphere.radius == lane_r32 sphere_r; (group struct remappings
together) Remap if statement conditions into a lane_u32 mask and remove
enclosing brace hierarchy (IMPORTANT you can still have if statements if
they apply to lanes, e.g. if mask_is_zeroed() break;) (TODO for
mask_is_zeroed() we want the masks to be either all 1’s or 0’s) (call
mask_is_zeroed() on all masks to early out as often as possible to get a
speed up) Once lofted all if statements, &amp; all the masks into a
single mask (it seems if there is large amounts of code inside the if
statements, you don’t want to do it this way and rather check if needing
to execute?) (IMPORTANT to only &amp; dependent masks, e.g. if there is
an intermediate if like a pick_mask or clamp, then don’t include it, but
do the conditional assign directly on this mask) Then enclose remaining
assignments in a conditional assignment function using this single mask?
(conditional_assign(&amp;var, final_mask, value); this uses positive
mask to get source and negative mask to get dest?) (also discover the
work around to perform binary operations on floating point numbers) So,
by end of this all values operated upon should be a lane type? (can have
some scalar types if appropriate) We may have situation where some items
in a lane may finish before others. So, introduce a lane_mask variable
that indicates this. To indicate say a break, we can do (lane_mask =
lane_mask &amp; (hit_value == 0)); For incrementing, will have to
introduce an incrementor value that will be zeroed out for the
appropriate lane item that has finished. Have horizontal_add()? Next
once everything remapped create a lane.h. Here, typedef the lane types
to their single variants to ensure working before adding actual simd
instructions Also do simd helper functions like horizontal_add(),
mask_is_zeroed() in one dimension first Wrap the single lane helper
functions and types in an if depending on the lane width set (IMPORTANT
any functions that we are to SIMD, place here. if it comes that we want
actual scalar, then rename with func_lane prefix)</p>
<p>for simd typically have to organically transition from AOS to SOA</p>
<p>Debug in single lane, single threaded mode (easier and debugger
works) However, can increase lane width as needed (threading not so
much?)</p>
<p>For bitwise SIMD instructions, the compiler does not need to know how
we are segmenting the register, e.g. 4x8, 8x8 etc. as the same result is
obtained performing on the entire register at once. So they only provide
one version of it, i.e. no epi32 only si128 Naming convention have
types: <code>__m128 (float), __m128i (integer), __m128d (double)</code>
and names in functions:
<code>epi32/si128 (integer), ps (float), pd (double)</code> Overload
operators on actual wide lane structs (IMPORTANT remember to do both
orders, e.g. (val / scalar) and (scalar / val)) Also have conversion
functions</p>
<p>Lane agnostic functions go at bottom (like +=, -=, &amp;=, most v3
functionality) (IMPORTANT it seems we can replace logical &amp;&amp; and
|| with binary for same functionality in simd)</p>
<p>(IMPORTANT simd does not handle unsigned conversions, may have to cut
off sign bit, e.g. &gt;&gt; 1)</p>
<p>process of casting type to pointer to access individual bytes or
containing elements (used in file reading too)</p>
<p>(IMPORTANT masks in SIMD will either be all 1’s or 0’s. perhaps have
a specific name for this to distinguish?)</p>
<p>(IMPORTANT seems that not all operations are provided in SSE, like
!=, so have to implement with some bitwise operations)</p>
<p>SIMD allows divide by zeros by default? (because nature of SIMD have
to allow divide by zeroes?)</p>
<p>To get over the fact that C doesn’t allow &amp; floating point,
reinterpret bit paradigm <code>*(u32 *)&amp;a</code> as oppose to cast
(IMPORTANT in SIMD cast is reinterpreting bits, so the opposite of cast
in C)</p>
<p>caching https://akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf 1. know cache sizes
to have data fit in it 2. know cache line sizes to ensure data is close
together (may have to separate components of structs to allow loops to
access less cache lines) i.e. understand what you operate on frequently.
may also have to align struct 3. simple, linear access patterns (or
prefetch instructions) for things larger than cache size</p>
<p>inline assembly (raw syscalls from github) HAVE TO INSPECT/VERIFY
ASSEMBLY IS SANE FIRST THEN LOOK AT TIMING INFORMATION inspecting
compiler generated assembly loops, look for JMP to ascertain looping
condition due to macro-op fusion (relevent to say Skylake), e.g. cmp-jmp
non-programmable instructions could be executed by the cpu similarly,
instructions that only exist on the frontend but exist programmatically
e.g. xmm to xmm might just be a renaming in register allocation table
also due to concurrent port usage, can identify parts of code as
relatively ‘free’ struct access typically off a [base pointer] in
assembly, 1.0f might be large number e.g. 1065353216 in assembly loop,
repeated instructions may be due to loop unrolling we might see: *
superfluous loading of values off stack * more instructions required,
e.g not efficiently using SIMD (often this exposes the misconception
that compilers are better than programmers; so better to handwrite
intrinsics)</p>
<p>comparing unoptimised assembly to ‘wc’ see noticeable speed increase.
example of non-pessimisation</p>
<p>Following the basic principles of non-pessimisation, I make a note of
the huge amount of cruft in the C STL. The output buffering, hidden
<code>malloc()</code> ‘optimisations’ (uncommitted memory, encounter
expensive page faults later; prefer reliability/clarity over
edge-performance benefits), OS line ending conversions, non-obvious use
of mutexes etc. Whilst these may seem like minor inconveniences, they
can be insidious for performance, e.g. <code>rand()</code> has a huge
call-stack that if we replace with a simple xor shift, results in 3x
speed up. Although easy to criticise, it may be the situation that the
CRT had to be that way because of C standards. To isolate use of the
CRT, wrap in functions so we can hopefully replace with system calls,
intrinisics, etc. Although generally okay to use STL, it forces you to
use their patterns (e.g. memory allocation, locks etc.). This is true
for STLs in general across all languages. Some may have bloatness from
other areas, e.g. C++ templates To avoid the compiler having to generate
a large export table of all functions, make them <code>static</code> To
avoid large amounts of linking and ∴ increase compilation time, have a
unity build. Furthermore, garunteed ability to inline functions (as with
multiple translation units, possible one might only have function
declaration and not definition) (issues may occur with slower
incremental builds when including 3rd party libraries; yet, can still
work around this possibly using ccache)</p>

<p>Caches are a way of minimising roundtrip time of RAM by putting
memory as close to the core that thinks will need it L1 closest, 1/2

<p>L1 can supply 2 cache lines per clock Instructions per clock, number
of work components, e.g. number of add components, cache line per
cycles, cache latency, agu (address resolver units) impose restrictions
A cache miss is simply stalling for an instruction. However, this may
not be an issue if we do other work, e.g. complex algorithm takes many
instructions hiding memory access for out of order cpu. If hyper
threading with two schedulers, if cache miss on one, just switch to the
other. Can really only know if a cache miss incurs a performance penalty
by looking at raw numbers from vtune, etc. Because of the scheduler,
it’s not as simple as just looking at memory sizes So, due to complex
overlapped/scheduling nature of modern CPUs can really only know if
cache miss incurs penalty with vtune Uop website displays table for

<p>Should be code of ethics in software to not create
bugs/inconveniences for users that couldve been avoided</p>
<p>An instruction of throughput 1 means issued every clock. As many
instructions take longer than 1 cycle, each core requires a scheduler to
see if it can execute something. View cpu as sections where there is
some distance to communicate.</p>
<p>Making some thing good takes time. However, if you have crazy design
practices it will also take longer You have to be reality based when
programming. That is in an engineering sense, to design something that
solves the problem you have People become attached to a way of
programming which doesn’t focus on solving the problem. They want to
build rube-goldberg machines Selectively attacking problems seriously
means you have a functional program quicker, whereby you can actually
decide if those other problems need to be addressed. Can defer hard
decisions later as they will be made better as you will have more
technical expertise and more context to work with</p>
<p>Testing is important. If you don’t write tests, your software doesn’t
work. However, write higher level system tests, not excessive unit
tests. More efficient and this is where bugs are likely to be. You often
have to remove code, so having unit tests just increases the volume of
code you have to write. Huge drain on productivity. Maybe for NASA. A
new paradigm should weigh up cost-benefit. Almost always the cost is
ignored and people gobble them up</p>
<p>To make computers better to use, have to simplify them on all
levels</p>
<p>Faster cpu like Apple’s m1 are irrelevant if software bad</p>
<p>Floating point math faster than integers</p>
<p>my style of programming and problems enjoy solving found in embedded,
e.g your constrained with the silicon not like in web where you just
build another data centre</p>
<p>Compiler works on file by file, so knows nothing about calls across
files. Therefore it generates object files which are partially
executable machine code with unresolved symbols. Linker merges these
object files and also adds extra header information so that the OS can
load our executable (or more specifically a kernel, e.g. linux)</p>
<p>Complete code coverage on the one hand is very thorough, however
don’t get a lot of engineering output. Furthermore, most bugs appear in
between systems not in units.</p>
<p>Best way to test is to release on early access. This checks hardware
and software, user may be running adobe acrobat which hogs cpu so
instruct them to kill it before running your game. Or maybe 20000 chrome
plugins. This is something a hardware lab can’t tell you</p>
<p>Process is allocated virtual memory space OS has mapping table that
converts these to physical addresses. Part of our processes address
space is pre-populated by the kernel program loader, e.g.  linux-vdso,
environment variables, etc. Kernel tunables: sudo sh -c ‘echo
kernel.perf_event_paranoid=0 &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf’ (sysctl)
User tunables: ulimit -a In virtual address space, have user space and
kernel space address ranges. A virtual address is mostly relating to
page table indexes and the last bit is a static offset (as for security
addresses are randomized)</p>
<p>To make an installer just fwrite your executable and then data files
appended with footer. Inside the exe, fread the exe and fseek based on

<p>Packed files better as less OS operations performing expensive file
handles etc.</p>
<p>Programming about solving problem. overlooked by design philosophies.
If you don’t have any functionality, you don’t have a structural
problem</p>
<p>const is only useful if you find it catches bugs for you (maybe for
globals instead of using #defines) however, in terms of optimsations,
const is useless as you can cast const away. therefore, for me, const is
mostly just a waste of typing. however, have to use for strings in C++
In a similar vein, VLAs useful here (note that sizeof(array) and
sizeof(pointer) for calculating string array count)</p>
<p>distinct areas of memory in assembly are stack, heap and data
(globals)</p>
<p>direction of stack growth is often determined by CPU. if selectable,
then OS. eg. x86 is downwards ulimit -s for stack size</p>
<p>good practice to assign variable for syntatical reasons, i.e. more
readable, e.g Controller *controller =
&amp;evdev_input_device.controller;</p>
<p>getconf can list POSIX system configurable variables</p>
<p>don’t go through a ton of unecessary stdlib. malloc probably more
optimised for small memory size requests relative to overall code base,
interfacing with system calls is not that much code (and can be
reused)</p>
<p>if we try to access memory from an invalid page (not reserved or
comitted) will get segfault. only have to worry about errors that don’t
manifest themselves on every run of the program.</p>
<p>on x86, writing by 32bit faster than 8bit as less instructions in
general, the fastest way is to use the widest possible register that can
be operated on at once the speed of accessing the memory from cache is
pretty cheap for nearby regions</p>
<p>don’t make changes for conceptual cleanliness. end of the day, want
to make performant, bug free code in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<p>when programming some days you are off. this just means you’re going
to be debugging a lot</p>
<p>we want it to be clear what our code can and cannot touch. global
variables make this hard (however, can add _ to see where they are all
used) however, as many OSs are rather janky and most code will live
outside this, it is ok to have some globals here globals are fine in
development. can repackage into a structure later.</p>
<p>clock speed not as relevent as improvements in microarchitecture and
number of cores means can be more efficient under less duress. also,
lower clock speed may be because want to draw less power.</p>
<p>short build times (under 10 seconds) are incredibly important to not
decentivness making changes and testing them</p>
<p>function overloading, generalised operator overloading and default
arguments are c++ features that can’t easily be implemented with gcc
extensions</p>
<p>note that &gt;&gt; will typically (implementation defined) perform
arithmetic shift (fill in with 1’s) on signed, so not always the same as
a divide. similarly, sign-extension just fills in the new MSBs with
1’s</p>
<p>for large cross-platform projects, best to differentiate with
filenames, rather than ifdefs. this also gives the ability to have
different control flows across the different platforms (essential)</p>
<p>for a game, better to have the game as a service to the OS (not the
other way round). this is becuase the game does not need to know/perform
the myriad of possible operations the OS can perform.</p>
<p>most modern cpus have a floating point unit, making them faster than
ints (same latency), e.g. a multiply is one instruction where ints is
two (multiply and shift) x87 is the FPU instructions for x86 (also have
SSE instructions which is want you ultimately want) however, for
multiplayer games, optimisers can give different results when using
floating point, e.g a platform that has operator fusion like a MULADD
may give different result when rounding then a platform that has do it
separate. (fixed point could solve this)</p>
<p>Programming Mentality: always important to know when coding what is
your goal. premature optimisation and design are bad. your goal
dictactes the quality of the code you write, e.g. allowed to be janky as
first pass on API. write usage code first.</p>
<p>often when having a variable lengthed array, ask ourselves do we
really need that?</p>
<p>asserts are part of debug program that are used to check that things
work that should always work. use them for a condition that must be true
that is not explicitly present</p>
<p>don’t think about memory management, but rather memory usage. if
having to worry about freeing etc. done something wrong.</p>
<p>when writing ‘spec’ code, no need to handle all cases; simply note
down the edge cases you should handle later on stop yourself thinking
about whether the code is messy or not. only care once problem is
solved!</p>
<p>it’s not the programming practice but the dogma that gets you. when
you start to name things it almost always becomes bad. almost all
programming practices have a place, just not used often so RAII people,
in case of things that must be released, e.g DeviceContext, ok to use a
constructor/destructor pair. I’ll throw you a bone there</p>
<p>streaming i/o is almost never a good choice (hard drive slowest, more
errors)</p>
<p>compression orientated programming is you code what you need at the
time (breaking out into function, combining into struct, etc.) over time
the code marches towards a better overall quality</p>
<p>amdahls law gives the time taken for execution given a number of
cogives the time taken for execution given a number of cores. for this
formula (indeed any formula) we can obtain some property by seeing as
function parameter approaches infinity. in this case, the parallelising
part drops out. brooks law says that simply adding more people to a
problem does not necessarily make it faster. if requires great deal of
coordination/communication actually slows down.</p>
<p>solving a problem: 1. decide what you are doing (this can’t be
open-ended.) 2. organise groups to achieve this by making these
boundaries, we are presupposing that each part is separate, e.g tyres
team and engine team; assume tyres and engine cannot be one piece.
therefore, the boundaries define what products you can make, i.e. you
produce products that are copies of yourself or how you are structured
so, in software if we assign teams for say audio, 2d, 3d we would expect
individual APIs for each. the org chart is the asymptote, so it’s the
best case that we make a product as granular as our org chart. it could
be far worse and even more granular therefore, communication between
teams is more costly than communication within teams. takeaway is that
low-cost things can be optimised, high-cost can’t be (further away on
the org chart) note that communication in code could just be someone
checking something in and you pulling it what we are seeing now with
modern software is the superposition of orgcharts due to use of legacy
codebases now we see org charts in software, where people are
artifically creating inheritence hierarcies that limit how the program
works this is very bad. the reason it’s done is for people to create
mental models that help them solve the problem as they can’t keep the
complexity in their head. it may be necesary to solve the problem,
however it shouldn’t be looked at as good. however, because it’s done
due to lack of understanding, the delegation/separation is not done with
enough information. so you limit possibilities of the design space. so
although, libraries, microservices, encapsulation, package managers,
engines may be necessary due to our brain capacity (until neuralink or
we figure out a better way to do them) they are not good! we may use
hash map, but only in a particular way They limit optimisation as we
have already decided separation so always be on the lookout for times
when you don’t have to do these most people just download hundreds of
libraries because they know it works and they won’t be worse than any
one else. WE MUST BE LEAN AND FLEXIBLE IN ORGCHARTS IN COMPANY AND IN
SOFTWARE TO INCREASE DESIGN. some old codebases need to be retired</p>
<p>DO THE ‘MOST CERTAIN’ THING FIRST. THIS COULD EITHER BE THE
IMPLEMENTATION OR THE USAGE CODE choose data structures around solving
problem</p>
<p>some software is scaffolding, i.e. not shipped with the final
product, e.g. editor for games</p>
<p>To make anything alternate over time, just multiply by
sine(time);</p>
<p>Data hiding hides what the CPU is doing, which is what we care
about</p>
<p>Require machine-specific documentation files to understand system we
are on System specific ctags template projects, e.g. linux kernel,
glibc, etc. If using library, have ctags for that project</p>
<p>ALMOST ALWAYS CAST TO FLOAT WHEN DOING DIVISIONS LEADING TO FLOAT</p>
<p>Minimum value starts at max</p>
<p>Spreading out randomness:
<code>final_value += contrib * sample</code></p>
<p>If debug code (or code that will not be in release) use compile-time
macros</p>
<p>Use GLOBAL and global_prefix If casting is occuring, always be
explicit about it! Prefixing functions with sdl2_func() or linux_func()
only if intending to be cross-platform</p>
<p>With error handling, bad practice is to allow a lot of errors, which
brings in error classes etc. Instead, if it’s something that is actually
an error, e.g. missing file, write the code to explicitly handle it.
Handling the error in a sense makes it no longer an error, rather a
feature of the program</p>
<p>if function is expecting a range between, should we clamp to it?</p>
<p>Refactoring Mentality: Refactoring is essential. You must know what
you are trying to achieve so you have some notion of progress,
e.g. adding a constraint to the system. (Replacing variable type in
scope gives us all locations where variable was used, including macros.
This us where dynamic lnguages fail as you don’t know if you broke
something)</p>
<p>You can abstract/encapsulate anything at anytime, so why not do it
later when you know what you are doing? We want file format to be simple
and binary, unlike json which is general purpose and string</p>
<p>modifying (parse as pointer arg), returning (result struct). it is
best to put simple types are arguments rather than a group struct to
allow for maximum code reuse. only put group struct as arguments if must
be put together (in general don’t pack so don’t force user to create a
struct when they may already have the values)</p>
<p>if can go functional without sacrificing, saves you complexity down
the road. oftentimes simply utilising elements of functional programming
is good, e.g. no global state, only operating on parameters etc.</p>
<p>writing code guides you to the right design, e.g. made same call
-&gt; put into function; require args in function -&gt; struct; many
related functions together -&gt; organise related functions into own
file; (if thinking could be moved to another file, make comment sections
outlining code blocks to ease this process later on) etc. (these are
simple, compression changes), complex api -&gt; transient struct,
overload functions for internal/external use There are also large
changes that are more difficult, e.g.  sections of single value
interpreted differently -&gt; pack 2 variables into 1 (_ technique
useful here) same operations performed on pairs of variables -&gt;
vectors (as oppose to working with them as scalars) vectors are
particularly useful as without them repeated actions quickly become
intractable It can get messy at times, but always know that a clean
solution is out there and you will refine towards it Work threw the
error tree one at a time Important to throw in asserts for underlying
assumptions. Also for debugging be aware of ‘copy-pasta’, e.g. copying
variables will have same name for two parameters as didn’t replace
it</p>
<p>we don’t want to orient our code around objects (if anything,
algorithmic oriented). its about how you arrive at some code that
determines how good it is</p>
<p>excessive pre-planning and setting waypoints is really only useful if
you’ve done the problem before (which in that case you’re not really
designing) instead, we become a good pathfinder, learning to recognise
the gradient of each day of the journey. when write the simplest thing
and loft it out into good design later (in this explorative phase, if we
make an changes for efficiency reasons we have just introduced the
possibilities of bugs with no benefit)</p>
<p>only break into function when you know what you want, e.g. called
multiple times or code finalised and improved readability (in which case
a tradeoff is made between understanding functionality and
semantics)</p>
<p>Don’t be scared of mass name changing!! Before doing so, see all
places where name is used Don’t be scared of long list of compiler
errors. Work your way through them</p>
<p>Refactoring with usage code: just write out structures that satisfy
the usage code. If major rewrite use #if 0 #endif to allow for
successful compiling</p>
<p>refactoring just copy code into function that gets it to compile.
later, worry about passing information in as a parameter basic debug and
release compiler flags When refactoring, utilise our vimrc <C-F> all
files Also, just pull code out into desired function and let the
compiler errors guide you Returning multiple values, just return struct
To reduce large number of function parameters, put into struct</p>
<p>Debugging Mentality: debugging stepping through pass-by-pass.
inspecting all variables and parameters and verifying state of
particular ones. make deductions about state of variables, e.g
overflowed, uninitialised, etc. drop in asserts draw it out</p>
<p>being able to draw out debug information is very useful. time spent
visualising is never wasted (in debugger expressions also)</p>
<p>When debugging, look through variables and see if anything looks
ridiculous</p>
<p>When in debugger, go iteratively progress through variable values in
function and see if they look right We can isolate some area of the code
and say this is probably the problem Then investigate relevent
sub-functions, etc. This can be a long process with seemingly little
gains. The issue could be subtle, e.g. signed/unsignedness size,
function called rarely</p>
<p>Configuration files should be copied, not generated (becomes too
messy) Symlink to template files from projects</p>
<p>To begin, I ensured that I had a debugger from which I could easily
step through the application’s execution. In code, I was able to
programmatically set system and user breakpoints.</p>
<p>(mocking of syscalls for unit testing with file i/o)</p>
<p>For handling non-fatal errors, single line check. For fatal errors,
nest all preceding code (I have learnt to not be afraid of indentation
in this manner). (error handling in general, i.e. reduce ‘errors’ by
making them part of normal execution flow)</p>
<p>When performing the common task of grouping data, a few practices to
keep in mind. Use fixed sized types to always know about struct padding
(in fact, I like to extend this to all my code)</p>
<p>If wanting multiple ways of accessing grouped data, use union and
anonymous structs. Use an int to reference other structs,
e.g. <code>plane_index</code></p>
<p>If the data being grouped can only exist together (e.g. points), use
vectors. Put all structs related typedefs inside their own header file
for easy access.</p>
<p>As floats are an approximation, when comparing to 0.0f (say for a
denominator check) or negative (say for a square root) use a
tolerance/epsilon less-than/greater-than check. In fact whenever
dividing should always ask oneself “can the value be zero?” To be clear
about float to int casting, use a macro like truncate/round (think about
what if uneven divide) Due to mixed integer and float arithmetic going
to float, calculate integer percentages <code>val * 100 / total</code>
There is no need to overload the division operator as can do
<code>(* 1.0f / val)</code></p>
<p>For easy substitution, use single letter prefix names like
<code>output_h</code> and <code>output_w</code>. Convention for variable
arrays, e.g. <code>Planes plane[1]</code>, <code>planes</code> and
<code>plane_count (use ARRAY_COUNT macro here)</code> Put for loop
statements on separate line to help not be afraid of indentation.
Iterate over pixel space and then convert to say, world space for
calculations (normalisation and lerp) Aspect ratio correction is simply
rearranging a ratio. If we determine one side is larger, scale other.
Use “ ASCII code to print a status indicator. Only use const for char *
string literals stored in the data segment.</p>
<p>Endianness comes into play when reading/writing from disk (e.g. file
type magic value) and working directly with <code>u8 *</code>
(e.g. iterating through bytes of a u32)</p>
